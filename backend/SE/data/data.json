A student \r\r\nwhose formal computer science background is deemed inadequate in any of the \r\r\nabove areas may be admitted on a provisional basis and will be required to take \r\r\nremedial courses prescribed by the Postgraduate Studies Committee and obtain a \r\r\ngrade of at least B in these courses. Such additional requirements will be \r\r\nstipulated in the individual offer of admission. Deficiencies in any core \r\r\ncomputer science area can be made up concurrently with postgraduate work. \nApplicants are required to submit: \r\r\n\u00a0 \n\nofficially certified academic transcripts of undergraduate studies (and \r\r\n\tpostgraduate studies, if any); \r\r\n\t\nresults of the computer science subject Graduate Record (GRE) (required \r\r\n\tfor PhD applicants only; may be taken and submitted in the year after \r\r\n\tadmission); \r\r\n\t\nresults of an English proficiency test (see below); \r\r\n\t\ntwo letters of recommendation: a one-page statement of plan for the \r\r\n\tpostgraduate study; and \r\r\n\t\na completed application form for postgraduate admission. \n\n\r\r\nFor admission into the MSc and MPhil programs, results of standard examinations, \r\r\nsuch as the computer science subject Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be \r\r\nhelpful in determining suitability for admission and should be submitted as \r\r\nsupplementary information, if available. \nAll students admitted into a postgraduate program must demonstrate sufficient \r\r\ncompetence in English. Students whose previous degrees are from an institution \r\r\nwhere the primary language of instruction is other than English should submit \r\r\nthe results of an English proficiency test (such as TOEFL) together with their \r\r\napplication. The English proficiency test must have been taken within two years \r\r\nof the time of application. Notwithstanding the above, the Department may \r\r\nrequire newly admitted students to undergo language proficiency assessment and, \r\r\nif deemed necessary, to take English language enhancement courses. \nAdmission to the Department's postgraduate programs will be based on the \r\r\napplicant's academic record as well as the research needs of the Department. \n\n\n"}

COMP: BEng in Computer Science\nThis is our general undergraduate program that provides broad education \r\r\n\tin all areas of Computer Science.\u00a0\n2. CSIE: BEng in Computer Science (Information Engineering)\nThis is a specialized undergraduate degree program focusing on the areas \r\r\n\tof multimedia computing and computer networking.\n\nWhile other Information Engineering programs in Hong Kong are closer to \r\r\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering, our CSIE program is unique in its \r\r\nemphasis on software. In fact, the CSIE program also satisfies all the general \r\r\nrequirements of a typical Computer Science program. It has been carefully \r\r\ndesigned with the specific needs of Hong Kong in mind.\u00a0\nBesides, the Department, jointly with the Department of Electrical and \r\r\nElectronic Engineering, also offers the BEng in Computer Engineering.\u00a0\n\u3000\nA Spectrum of IT-Related Programs\nThe programs offered by our Department and the Department of Electrical and \r\r\nElectronic Engineering can be best viewed as the following spectrum:\nSoftware<----------------------->Hardware\nCOMP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CSIE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPEG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EEIC\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ELEC\nGenerally speaking, the emphasis shifts from \"soft\" to \"hard\" as we move \r\r\nacross the spectrum. The different programs suit different student interests and \r\r\njob market demands.\u00a0\n\u3000\nOther Opportunities\nBesides the regular study programs, Computer Science students at HKUST also \r\r\nenjoy a number of other opportunities, including the following:\u00a0\n\nOverseas exchange program:\nOne-year full-time overseas study by paying only HKUST's tuition fee\u00a0 \r\r\n\t\nWork-study program:\nOne-year full-time work outside HKUST after two years of study \r\r\n\t\nIndustrial training:\nTraining modules during winter and summer breaks on specific practical \r\r\n\tskills\u00a0 \r\r\n\t\nEnglish training:\nIntensive training in written and conversational English, including \r\r\n\tpresentation skills \r\r\n\t\nFinal year projects:\nOne year project in an area of specialization under the guidance of \r\r\n\tfaculty advisors\u00a0 \r\r\n\t\nStudent tutors:\nSecond and third year student helpers providing help to students in \r\r\n\tfirst-year courses \n\n\u3000\nOur Graduates\nAbout 20% of our graduates choose to pursue postgraduate study immediately \r\r\nafter graduation. While many of them stayed in HKUST for MPhil (Master of \r\r\nPhilosophy) study, some went abroad to study at top universities, including \r\r\nStanford University, University of Southern California, University of Toronto, \r\r\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\u00a0\nThose who choose to work found excellent jobs. While graduates from related \r\r\ndisciplines also look for computing related jobs, Computer Science graduates \r\r\nclearly have great advantages after completing a comprehensive program that \r\r\nprovides solid training in fundamentals and many emerging areas of IT and \r\r\ncomputing.\n\u3000\nInquiries\nStudents who need advice or assistance on application procedures, choice of \r\r\nprograms, entrance requirements or other related matters are welcome to contact \r\r\nus:\u00a0\n\u3000\n\n\n"}

It \r\r\nis therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared \r\r\nin general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. \r\r\nThe same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications \r\r\nused in Volume 9 are continued this year. A data base is considered \r\r\nto be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing \r\r\nbibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). \r\r\nThe data bases that we will consider are used for information storage \r\r\nand retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or \r\r\ndata base generation. \r\r\nThe choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas. First, \r\r\ndata bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic \r\r\ninformation, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. \r\r\nThus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number \r\r\nis a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as \r\r\nthat by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) \r\r\nare excluded. Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material \r\r\nis included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most \r\r\nof the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a \r\r\nshipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this \r\r\nchapter. Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation \r\r\nof publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production \r\r\noperation. \nBack to Books\n\n\n"}

Thus, we will find \r\r\nin the literature both a frankly subjective notion of \r\r\nrelevance as reported by individual users, and equations, \r\r\ncurves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide \r\r\nnumerical measures of the recall and relevance \r\r\ncharacteristics of information systems. This phenomenon \r\r\nof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective \r\r\nand non-mathematical term to equations in which the \r\r\nsame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical \r\r\ndefinition has its ancient parallel in discussions \r\r\nof probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the \r\r\nmeaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out, \r\r\non \"who is master,\" the user or the term. On the other hand, \r\r\nthe use of a single term in the same document to cover \r\r\ntwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such a \r\r\nusage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine \r\r\nby attributing to it mathematical validity which it does \r\r\nnot have, represents a more serious situation than merely \r\r\ncareless ambiguity. \nBack to Books\n\n\n"}

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-Good Troma-tic fun., 30 April 2006Author:John Lindsey (Johnlindsey289@hotmail.Com) from Socorro, New Mexico USA.A couple of years after the original movie, Tromaville has gotten a newuniversity merged with the nuclear power plant called \"The TromavilleInstitute of Technology ( a.k.a. TIT)\" and it seems like a perfectplace to have campus life with booze, hot chicks who wear bikinis, andbeing yourself. However a scientist named Professor Holt ( Lisa Gaye)has been creating humanoid beings out of chemicals called Sub-Humanoidswho are perfect for slavery, pleasure and to serve people but howeverthey are different than the average normal human being as they havesecond mouths for bellybuttons and they would sometimes go intomeltdown into slimy gooey little creatures if they hurt people. Acereporter Roger Smith ( Brick Bronsky) is on the verge to find out aboutthe secret of who is behind these sub-humanoids even if he falls forone.Weak but fun sequel to the 1986 cult trash classic from Troma with theusual knockers, self referential material, nudity, and gross out humorwith it. I did however thought that girl Roger falls for is a totalhottie even though her character had a mouth on her stomach, if your inthe mood for goofy no-brain fun then watch this if you liked theoriginal.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Class of Nuke 'Em High Part II: Subhumanoid Meltdown (1991)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Class of Nuke 'Em High 3: The Good, the Bad and the SubhumanoidClass of Nuke 'Em HighThe Toxic Avenger, Part IIPorky's RevengeThe Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of ToxieIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-A Concert More For Women, I Guess, 7 April 2007Author:ccthemovieman-1 from Lockport, NY, United StatesI had heard several times that Neil Diamond was a fabulous performer,one of the best of his generation and a big reason his concerts wereimmensely. That inspired me to get this VHS, but I didn't find himanything special. I guess he's someone who appeals a lot more to women.They seemed to go nuts over him, really getting into his songs as onecan see on this concert tape.Actually, after awhile the women are annoying to watch, being a littleover-dramatic in the audience. That's nothing new. They did it back inFrank Sinatra's heyday, and with Elvis and then the Beatles, etc. Anyway, I have no complaints about the music. I've always liked most ofDiamond's numbers and he does them justice in this concert filmed atthe Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles, Ca., in 1988. Most of the songs inthis are solid, but I'd rather listen to him and see all the stupidwomen making fools of themselves in the audience.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Neil Diamond: Greatest Hits Live (1988) (V)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:John Denver: The Wildlife ConcertAlabama: 41 Number One Hits LiveRolling Stone Presents Twenty Years of Rock & RollA Night in Havana: Dizzy Gillespie in CubaJimi Plays MontereyIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I simply could not breakmyself away from the video; it was so spellbinding. The intimacy of theactors in their relationship with each other was very moving. Everyonebrought intensity, passion, warmth, desperation, frustration, etc. It wasall there with such believability. The last scene with Beethoven and JohannaReiss was heart wrenching. The expression on Oldman's face as he realizedhis fate simply reduced me to tears. His pain juxtaposed with Steege'sinternalized passivity was one of the finest pieces of acting I have seen ina long time.

YesWell-acted ?Yes, 19 March 2006Author:glennandrews from SwedenAlways a pleasure to enjoy the talent of Julie Walters, here she issupported by an exceptionally gifted cast. Starting and ending in theluxury of New York, the main story in the film takes place in the slumsof Liverpool with any number of quite believable scenes. The supportingcast may be drawn with a rather thick felt pen but add enormous colourto the general atmosphere. This is a film which will obviously meanmore to, and be enjoyed more by English audiences. So much of thedialogue and so many remarks are probably incomprehensible to othernationalities and that includes Americans. This is a film to be enjoyedfor all its good points and not to be criticized for all itsweaknessess.

Steve Burrows is more committed to the art offunny than anyone I've ever met. His timing is impeccable, hisperformance is charming, his writing is off-beat, and he's not apretty boy (at all). I've had the pleasure of working with Steverecently, and this movie is one of the reasons why I even wantedto. See it as soon as it's released (last Iheard was later thisyear).Whoever gave this film a BAD review has no sense of humor. Youcan't deny funny when it's there. And funny is all over this flick.Okay, nuff said. See the film. Even if it's just because Steve's a niceguy.

I was actually surprised by howgood DMX could pull off his role as the King. This movie really showsthe gritty, nasty truth of drug induced violence. There are no goodpeople in this film, and there are no heroes to speak of. There arejust ugly, evil, menacing things and people sewn completely through anyattempt at good morals. This movie definitely hold no bars on how farit goes. It shows practically rape, murders of innocents, hard drugs,and intentionally making someone you love addicted to heroin. DMX trulyshows the King as an evil and god-awful person and by the end of themovie, it is quite satisfying to connect it to the beginning. I can'tsay this is a great movie because there aren't any redeeming values toit, and there is really no point in it. It does however chill yourbones in it truthfulness, and sparks an issue that can be debated afterthe movie is complete.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-How sweet..!, 9 April 2004Author:MoonliqhtRiver from New Jersey, USAAfter I had watched this movie I thought.. \"How sweet to see an oldercouplefalling in love like that on screen\"! You may not understand what I meanbythat but I'll explain.I am pretty young (15 yrs. old) but mature to some my age! I love \"lovestories\". And on average now you usually see the young/beautiful (in someppl's opinions) people in love movies! And to see Diane & Jack play theseroles.. and basically show that even when you are at that age how devineitis :) In my opinion I think Diane is beautiful also. My point is: I reallyenjoy seeing the older couples sometimes on screen... to know what myparents exactly go there & feel (but never tell me) like that. B/c that isreality and truth -not just your young love, we don't stay young foreverlol! But yes I know there are movies that have older couples, but they areusually just there. I mean on average movies most of the time excuse thefact that how much in love they still are (which I adore)... especiallylikethis movie!Alright on to the movie -I have read what people have been saying thatSomething's Gotta Give is predictable. Uhm well of course, I knew how itKINDA baselined to be from trailers also. But come on how many lovestoriesdo that?? They end up falling in love.. then have troubles.. at the endgettogether! A LOT. But to those who are reading this right now: IT IS NOT*ALL* PREDICTABLE!!I love Keanu Reeves in this movie! He is very sweet and truly in love.. hewas just right. I actually enjoyed him the best (besides Diane & Jack'slove). Why you might ask? Hm.. let me just say Keanu played a better guythen Jack (him being a young ladies man/player).But all in all I really liked it! At times (cus of its length) it may dragalittle, but that is it's only faults. It has enough humor/love/sweetness,lol, to make it a great movie!! It all depends on your tastes too (I'veheard from various ppl that mainly it's a married woman's type of movie).But anyone could like it I believe, so at your very least... you can rentit, hopefully then it'll be led to buying it :DI give it a 8.5/10! *AlainaWas the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Something's Gotta Give (2003)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserNicholson's cell phoneuberpikeMarin's Husband and PregnancyNicoliHPhave you ..?nrjetik81edited for TVsnowboardgirl290the absolutely BEST quote of this movie is missing in the quotes sectionalvaro2908-1Contraception......my_i_me_minemoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:The NotebookSaving FaceSomething NewThe Phantom of the OperaPlayboy Video Centerfold: The Dahm TripletsIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Now, the sequel to the hit is aboutCrysta, of course, and all of her friends. First it's all happy andeverything. Everyone in FernGully is having a high-ol'-time. But thensomething happens...Two poachers (\"Boss\" and Mac) come to the woods with two dogs. The twothen kidnap the poor baby animals and take them to the circus. On the wayout of the forest, they also manage to burn it down. Now, busy withregrowing trees, FernGully puts the fetching of the animals job on theshoulders of Pips and his gang, along with Batty Koda.Anyways, I was watching this the other night out of boredom, and evenlaughed some. I think it is a good sequel that lives up to the firstFernGully and encourage parents to buy it for their children to add totheirmovie collection.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue (1998) (V)Recent Posts (updated daily)Userhow come...Little_devil394ferngully storyYgGrasshopperThe Song..lilcutiewitabootie_08moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Toy Story 2The Lion King II: Simba's PrideReturn to Never LandStitch!

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-you can try, but you can never go home, 1 May 2005Author:Tom (bighouseaz) from United StatesAfter a 23 year absence, Zatoichi returns to his home town to find thatfew remember him. But in the end the village residents will have muchto remember him by.Of course Zatoichi is in a sentimental mood. There is a funny scenewhere Zato mistakenly thinks that the town has set up a big banquet inhis honor and he frets over how to greet his guests and thank them.There is a touching scene where Zato comes across a Jizo (Buddha)statue along side a road where he used to play as a child. Jizo ismissing his stone head, so Zatoichi gets on hands and knees to find themissing head. In the end he finds the head and replaces it on Jizo'sshoulders. Zato visits the grave of his 'aunti' who breast fed him andoffers sake (taking a nip himself :) ).The second half of the film is fast paced and has an interesting story.It's a story of greed and the story is being sown by Zatoichi'schildhood friend, who has returned to the village at the same time asZatoichi. Their confrontation is predictable, but Zatoichi takes out ahost of yakuza to eventually confront his childhood friend. Overall,it's a compelling story and has a lot of good action.So this film marks the 25th film in a period of 12 years. It'sinteresting that the series pauses at this point. The next film (andlast) will be released in 1989. I would rank Zatoichi Conspiracy higherthan several of the earlier films in the series, but the Japanesepublic must have had enough by this point.

For a young director, Ms. Paci, shows a lot of talent inthe way she has constructed the film and in the performances she getsfrom her actors.The film presents the story of Gilda, a young woman getting over thedeath of her father. At the same time, it's revealed, accidentally, herfather might have been involved with another woman. Her reaction is nottypical, as she decides to go away to her grandparents in New York as away to rebel against her mother. She also goes hoping to meet an actorwho she has been obsessed with.Getting to know this man proves to be a let down for Gilda. This youngwoman feels betrayed by all the men she had loved and suddenly realizeswhere she belongs and returns home to make peace with her mother, whoGilda has blamed, in a way, for all that has gone wrong in her life.Susan May Pratt, is Gilda. Her performance seems effortless. Chris Nothis perfect as the egotistical Michael De Santis, the well known actorand the object of Gilda's love. Laila Robins, an extraordinary actresswho works in the New York theatre extensively, brings an intelligentapproach to Gilda's mother, who has also been betrayed by her husband.Mary Louise Wilson and Josef Sommer make brief appearances as Gilda'sgrandparents. Also, Michele Placido is seen as Giorgio.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Searching for Paradise (2002)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserI f you could get a celeb to take you to their hotel room who?magicpowerswhere????swxt_avenged7xPlease tell me someone else saw thispotblackettlemoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Menace II SocietyThe MightyEdgeNebraskaDonnie DarkoIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

She gets a job at the Spitfire Grillrun by Hannah (Burstyn). Starting over in a small New England town withits clannish ways and suspicions of strangers is not easy and Percy hasa hard row to hoe.A friend of mine said they don't make movies like this anymore and heis right. The owner of the Prime Time Video store says this movie isalways going out the door and did surmise that it might be a cultmovie. He has not seen it yet. Well, it's not a cult movie. It's simplya very good story.It's a wonderful true to life story about three women (Gay Harden beingthe other one) who carry their baggage with them and try to get by.Percy is haunted by her past; Hannah is guilt-ridden regarding herfamily; and Shelby (Gay Harden) is tormented by her husband. All threeneed each other to understand each is not alone.I went back to 1996 and 1997 to see if this movie or stars had beennominated for anything in the Academy Awards. Nothing was found, butthere should have been something or someone nominated. I would haveguessed that Marcia Gay Harden would have been nominated for a bestsupporting actress award. She would have had my vote.Although made in 1996, I suppose this is the type of movie that goesout the door a lot because of word of mouth. If you see this movie,pass it on. It is a very good story.BTW: the friend who recommended this to me owes me a box of Kleenix.Yeah, you're gonna need it.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Spitfire Grill (1996)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserThe ending?Destinygirlk-1Who was Eli?ashputtlelyrics-mini spoilermildlypsychoticHannah's safe at the Spitfire GrillthorsailPercy Christ?sjberkeClare, the Contest WinnerpetsismemoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:A Map of the WorldPeyton PlaceA Child Is MissingInfamousEk Hasina ThiIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)6 out of 6 people found the following comment useful:-Power at his most charming., 23 June 1999Author:David Atfield (bits@alphalink.com.au) from Canberra, AustraliaTyrone Power is so charismatic in this film that the rest of it hardlymatters.His astonishing good looks and easy charm really make this film.But there is also good direction, a witty script, great Oscar-winningspecial effects and fine cinematography.Betty Grable has never done much for me, but she's pleasant enough inthis.But the aerial work, done mostly with models, is exceptionally strongparticularly in a spectacular and believable recreation of the evacuationatDunkirk.This is a war propaganda film, designed to encourage the USA tojoin the war in Europe - but it is not cloyingly over patriotic.Andthereare some very original moments - look at the scene where Power wakes upanddoesn't know where he is.The camera stays in extreme close-up on hisfacefor a long time, so we don't know where he is either.We see him gothroughfear and bewilderment as we hear strange sounds.Finally his face relaxesand the camera pulls back to reveal...well I don't want to spoil it foryou,but this is a very strong directorial decision.Henry King is to bepraised.You'll enjoy this film.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for A Yank in the R.A.F.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)3 out of 5 people found the following comment useful:-Troubling but Timely, 1 February 2005Author:eht5y from United StatesThe Weatherman faction remains one of the more troubling aspects of the60s counterculture, for manifold reasons. How did a bunch ofwell-educated, relatively privileged white kids transform fromidealistic protesters for peace into revolutionary terrorists? How werethey able to reconcile the inherent contradiction of using violence asa means of pursuing peace? Can violence ever lead to reconciliation, ormust it necessarily beget more violence? Sam Green and Bill Siegel'sdocumentary examines all of these questions while remaining remarkablyobjective. It's a pity that we should feel surprised when a documentaryfilmmaker actually attempts to uphold the all-but-obsolete standard ofobjectivity; nevertheless, Green and Siegel deserve to be complimentedfor presenting a film that is perhaps more a window into the confusionof the times than a history of one peculiar faction of anti-governmentactivists.Green & Siegel intersperse archival footage with commentary by a numberof the Weather Underground's leaders, most of whom retain theirrevolutionary idealism, even if they have grown circumspect about theirmethodology.The film persuasively channels the aura of violence and politicalunrest that characterized American culture as the first vestiges ofcounter-cultural idealism gave way first to frustration as the war inVietnam escalated and then to radicalism as, one after another, civiland human rights activists ranging from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. toChicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton were brutally silenced,possibly by order of American government agencies such as the CIA, NSA,and FBI. Simultaneously, the tenor of apolitical American life shiftedfrom the good vibrations of psychedelia to paranoia and suspicion. Theimage of the blissed-out, peace-loving, groovy hippie was replaced bythe crazed expression of Charles Manson, whose murderous id made everyGod-fearing citizen's worst nightmares reality: acid-crazed hippiesrampaging the suburbs, butchering innocents in order to start arevolution that would overthrow the status quo. Siegel's and Green'sdirection employs numerous archival clips that are shockingly graphic,including horrific footage of executions and the bodies of civiliancasualties in Vietnam (including many women and small children) anduncensored crime scene photographs from the Tate-LaBianca murdersordered by Charles Manson. The material is somewhat objectionable, butserves the purpose of expressing the climate of fear that made itpossible for the likes of Mark Rudd--now a quiet, somewhat melancholymath teacher at a community college in New Mexico--to drop out of sightand begin plotting the violent overthrow of the American politicalsystem.The film presents the Weather Underground as admirable in its courageand determination, but also as terminally misguided. Weatherman leadersrepeatedly express their solidarity with the Black Panthers and anyrevolutionary movement of underclass 'brown or black' people on theplanet, but the few Panthers who comment for the film either disavowthe Weathermen or express perplexity at their determination to identifywith the struggle of blacks and other oppressed ethnicities. As adults,several of the group members acknowledge that, even when they wereharassed or beaten by police, they were still treated far more humanelythan their black counterparts, and so were never truly in the samestruggle as those whom they supported. Some of the members still speaknostalgically about their Weathermen days and claim that they'd do itall over again; others express disdain and regret over their complicityin the deaths of innocents.As we begin to see history repeating itself in Iraq, 'The WeatherUnderground' is all too timely. What was different about the 60s and70s, when so many young people became committed to political activism,from the present, when the numbers are relatively few? Will the processthat brought about the Weather Underground repeat itself, or was thisparticular group less a consequence of the times than of the choices ofa few charismatic but misguided and naive twenty-somethings? DidWeatherman make a difference, or was it simply another small piece ofthe catastrophic collage of the Vietnam era? This film raises morequestions than it answers--which is probably what art should always tryto do.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Weather Underground (2002)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserDid they really support Charlie Manson??dododadadodowere the weathermen right?thinkingmachinethe weather man were LOSERSwrensalertDig thishoobler878where is today's SDSpepsivanillaAnother song question -slide guitaradamrl-1moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:UndergroundNeverland: The Rise and Fall of the Symbionese Liberation ArmyPunishment ParkIn the Year of the PigMedium CoolIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It's like JoeEszterhas picked up his old \"Basic Instinct\" script and simply startedchanging some of the characters names and added or changed just somefew situations. They pathetically tried to surprise the audience withsome plot twist that you could see from miles away. Halfway trough themovie I already knew who the person was they were chasing. That meanseither two things; I'm smart or the writer is just stupid, I think thatthe second one sounds more probable. And what was with the final plottwist at the end? That really didn't made sense as did the entire moviethat was just filled with some major plot holes.Also the style was very incoherent. Only the second half of the moviethe movie gets a nice visual style with some good camera-work. Still the movie is perfectly watchable for one simple reason; The carchases. The car chases and crashes are really spectacular like youcould expect from director William Friedkin, the guy who brought us\"The French Connection\". Although it is a bit strange that no matterhow hard the cars crash into thing, in the next shot the car alwayslooks tip-top again.Watchable but most certainly not recommendable soft-erotic/thriller.5/10Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Jade (1995)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserFriedkin the true writer?WTFmp989Subliminal images and messages?sojiroseta52WIDESCREEN VERSIONthx11384ebDid anyone really liked it?artemiss_84Different versions, aspect ratio, lousy dvdetc Helpmp989Angie EverhartladyorthetygrmoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Basic InstinctThe Last SeductionMagnum ForceBody HeatPresumed InnocentIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I am not aShakespeare expert,but I love history and the 1930s and 1940s are myfavourite period,so I love the way the our odd Royal Family is shown inthis film,we know that members of the royal family were pro fascist inthe 1930s so why not update the original story. The locations and theproduction design are great and the acting is impressive throughout. Asfor the comment about the murder in bed,it seems like a good plan tome,if you were busy with a flight attendant you are not going to noticean assassin under the bed.

The stars power in this movieis great, we have Carina Lau has Selina the lead actress who is apsychoanalyst, who hang out with her friends (Athena Chu has a eroticstory for woman, Yoyo Mung has a multi-restaurant owner who like thedanger side, and Pinky Cheung whose dad is a triad boss goes retirementand know how to fight). The story begin when Selina ex came to her andask her to take care of her wild daughter (Cecilia Cheung in anotherbizarre look) and tried to cure her wild behaviour. Well the rest ofthe storyline consist of the 4 woman and there relationship with theguys, we have Tony Leung Ka Fai going after Carina Lau, Athena Chugoing after Edisen Chen, Picky Cheung going after Andy Hui, and Lu Yigoing after Yoyo Mung. The movie was mildly entertaining and the stars in this movie were funto watch, but the flow and situation of the story do get tiring. AndyHui look hot with his bodyguard suit and his non facial expression.Some of the stuff in this movie is just a recycle from other movies(Analysis This for one), which make the movie rather less enjoyable.The narrative talk from Carina was excitement giving us enoughinformation on her friends and fine performance from everyone exceptEdisen Chen (I don't hate this fellow Canadian). This movie lack newidea, and the comedy is not that funny, I can't really compare to theHBO series because I never watched it.If you are fans of any of these stars I recommend watching this becausethe movie wasn't boring at all.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-Propaganda movie with a love triangle thrown in, 9 August 2005Author:blanche-2 from United StatesFantastic special effects highlight this World War II submarine dramastarring Tyrone Power, Dana Andrews, and Anne Baxter - Power's lastbefore going into the Marines.Power is charming as a man who captures the heart of Anne Baxter, whothough he doesn't know it, just happens to be the girl of Dana Andrews,Power's new commanding officer.Out on the submarine, there's some exciting action as the sub searchesfor a secret base set up by the Nazis. One interesting subplot is thefriendship of Oliver, a black soldier, with Mac, portrayed by JamesGleason. Ben Carter, who played Oliver, does a great job, and his roleas a concerned friend and brave soldier is not the usual stereotypicalone blacks were often forced to play. The ending, of course, is pure propaganda as Power, supposedly talkingto his uncle, talks about the fighting men, subs, PT boats, and thelike all doing their job. I'm in no way trying to denigrate it -propaganda is a fascinating part of film history and at that time wasdeemed important to the war movement. It's all very interesting to viewtoday. And Power is gorgeous.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Crash Dive (1943)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:LifeboatThe Guns of NavaroneRaiders of the Lost ArkAction in the North AtlanticHell BelowIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Atfirst, she's just a pawn in a situation that she wasn't supposed to bea part of, but as each person gets killed coming after the money, shebecomes the aggressor and wants to keep the money badly so that she canstart life anew in another country. This movie is thrilling,exhilarating, comic, tragic, frightening and full of twists and turns.The woman in the middle of everything is played superbly by LalitaPanyopas as she gets deeper and deeper into her situation and becomesmore and more hardlined. As she cleans the blood from her apartmentafter each killing she breaks down only once, and then gives into herobsession completely during a wonderful scene where she lets her bestfriend see what's been going on in her life lately as she dumps thebodies in a nearby lake. This is one of those \"one of a kind\" foreignmovies that grips you more and more as it goes on. Americans; pleasedon't be frightened by subtitles, the blood, or the fact that we get tosee a couple of individuals urinate into a toilet!! Let's grow up!!This is a great thriller from Thailand that should be enjoyed by a lotof people, not just by those who speak the same language and know theway things are in the country it was made.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ruang talok 69 (1999)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserThis movie is way underrated.quantaumfoamOne of the best films...wiseman-4music for 69alec886moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Ong-bakThe Whole Nine YardsThe WinnerOne Eight SevenAnother 48 Hrs.IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)6 out of 10 people found the following comment useful:-Incoherent conspiracy comedy-thriller which works neither as a comedy nor a thriller., 3 January 2006Author:Jonathon Dabell (barnabyrudge@hotmail.com) from Wakefield, EnglandWinter Kills is a terrible, incoherent and very disappointingconspiracy comedy-thriller from little-known director William Richert.While watching the film, I honestly felt as if I was the emperor in theclassic fable The Emperor's New Clothes. The film made me feel like afool because I couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot andthe nonsensical characters. But I felt kind of embarrassed to admit tomyself that the film was tying my brain up in knots. So I stuck with itto the end, hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself.Then I realised.... the film is SUPPOSED to be serpentine, nonsensicaland illogical, because that's the whole point. This is a satirical lookat conspiracy theories and theorists, with the knotting-up of the plotused as a metaphor for the knotting-up of truths, half-truths and liesthat define any conspiracy. Even when I got that the joke was on me, Istill felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie.Young Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) is the younger brother of a formerUnited States President who was assassinated in Philadelphia. Nick ispresent when a dying man claims that he shot the President and givesdetailed information about where he hid the gun. Nick follows theclues, but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die inmysterious circumstances. Also, his father Pa Kegan (John Huston), avulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman, keeps interfering withNick's investigation. The deeper he delves into the assassination, themore Nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies andred herrings, where nothing is as it seems and no-one can be trusted.The film is an utter nightmare to follow, and in many ways is not worthtrying to follow for the afore-mentioned reason that it deliberatelytangles itself up. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent butmost of them are wasted. Toshiro Mifune has one of the briefest andmost pointless cameo roles in cinematic history; Elizabeth Taylorappears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue; Richard Booneis given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goesnowhere. John Huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch andprovides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbicdelivery. Anthony Perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well,though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to thecharacter. Some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reasonand, while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs, theyreally belong in another film. The film's semi-comic climax is farcicaland disappointing, yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way.There's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for WinterKills.... but I won't be counting myself among its number.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Winter Kills (1979)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserWhata CastecarleWhat really happened to this movie?ukkid35moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Wag the DogThe Second Civil WarBeing ThereMan of the YearJFKIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The quality is leaps and bounds over the series, andthe movie is made to be a fan's dream. The entire movie start to finishseems made with the fan in mind. The animation quality is top notch. Fromthe little things like eye movement to the big things like debris anddestruction of a city. It's all done superbly well and it all looksabsolutely wonderful.The story is quite nice as well, though nothing too extreme. They managed tosqueeze in the origins of just about anything and everything. Yet, it neverseems forced... there's never a scene that was obviously put in just toexplain something.The sound and music is perfect with the movie. The music fits it very welland the subtle cues really draw the fans in. The VA's do a wonderful job aswell, there's really nothing to dislike.It's far from a deep movie, and it's certainly no epic animation. But forfans of the show it's PPG perfection. For folks yet to see the show, it's avery entertaining flick well worth your time. The full length commentary onthe dvd by the director and art director is well worth watching by itself.Not only is it great to hear a behind the scenes look, there's many greattips for artists spread around on how they made certain effects and madesome effects easier. The commentary is worth the rentalalone.- Rirath_comWas the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Powerpuff Girls (2002)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserMovie was announced in year 2000BeletjeAbout Mojo JoJo's plan......angussuWhere's the Extra Guy????yomi_15Why did I even watch it?David_HowardVERY DISSAPOINTINGpinknavelringFavorite Powerpuffpowerpuffkn-1moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:The IncrediblesThe FlintstonesSpy Kids 2: Island of Lost DreamsSpy Kids 3-D: Game OverThe Transformers: The MovieIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Episodes 1-8 start after the 8th episode of the OAV series. They are based on the original Record of Lodoss War novels #3-4 by Ryo Mizuno entitled \"The Dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain I & II\". Episodes 9-27 follow the stories of the original novels #6-7 entitled \"The Holy Knight of Lodoss I & II\". Which in turn spawned the manga (18 issues) & graphic novels (6 books) available in English from CPM Manga entitled \"Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight\". It is that manga series that the name of this anime series comes. Some people believe that the writers and directors \"rewrote\" the story found in episodes 9-13 in the OAV series, where in reality the intent was to convey the story as it was originally written by Mr. Mizuno the Lodoss series author and creator.moreQuotes:Narrator:There once was a boy, who dreamt of living in a world of light.

(relates to dubbed version), 25 February 2001Author:pixie468 from Southern Florida\"Record of the Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight\" is an awesome 27episode anime series. The first eight (or so) episodes are about the freeknight Parn, his elven companion Deedlit, and many others who make awonderful mercenary group. They cast spells, fight evil beings, and preventa black knight from taking control of Lodoss, the Accursed Island.The following 19 episodes are my favorite though. It's nine years later, andthe knight-in-training Spark and his recruited soldiers must save the worldfrom a dark sorcerer and cunning goddess. The animation is very colorful andclean. The dialogue could use some help,but the voices that speak it are very intelligible and appropriate. I lovedthe action, and I couldn't help myself from rooting for the the \"bad guys\"in some cases. This television series is a great find for anime fans andfantasy/adventure lovers. I cheered, laughed, cried, and even dreamed aboutthis series.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \"Lodoss to Senki: Eiyuu kishi den\" (1998)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Lodoss to senki\"Slayers\"\"Bakuretsu hunters\"Banpaia hant\u00e2 DGanso bakuretsu hunterIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I was wrong. A good cast (Roy Scheider as the president) didn't help it any. Thestory had every conceivable possible worst-case scenario that couldtake place in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of it couldPOSSIBLY happen! True -- the kidnapping of the President could only be accomplished withthe inside help of a traitor in the Secret Service (ala Air Force One),but everything they depicted regarding the FOOTBALL and thehelplessness of our country if were to fall into enemy hands isludicrous to the Nth degree. Seriously, not even the President canfully over-ride our missile control. The case is only used to relayorders. In this situation, our system would have completely deleted thecodes and the whole thing would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijingcouldn't happen -- there would not have been a missile launch becausethe silo-crews would have been instructed not to (communicationsinclude a hardwired system). There are just too many safe-guards toprevent such a thing from happening. True, film's like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE gave some credibility tothe concept of us losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this film goes toofar and fails to suspend my concept of the unbelievable. And that makesthe experience a waste of the viewer's time.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-Two or Three Things He Knows -Godard's long goodbye continues with a meditation on war and a history of the cinema, 11 February 2007Author:apwbd154 from United StatesNotre Musique is the latest, but scarcely the least, of Jean-LucGodard's elegies for 20th-century Europe, the cinema, and himself.Olympian in its detachment, the movie is heartfelt in a desire toacknowledge the Other\u2014as its guardian angel.Unlike Godard's last film, In Praise of Love, Notre Musique searches,if not for cosmic harmony, then for some sort of secular redemption.Has our irascible JLG been reconciled? The 73-year-old director'sserene meditation on Europe's landscape after battle has an unusuallyobvious triptych structure, with each panel (or act) named for one ofDante's three \"kingdoms.\" The central, hour-long \"Purgatory\" of awriters' conference in Sarajevo bridges the opening 10-minute \"Hell\"and a concluding 10-minute \"Heaven.\" \"Hell\" is a sensationally editedfound-footage montage that yokes together clips from newsreels and allmanner of movies (Alexander Nevsky, Fort Apache, and Kiss Me Deadly).Are these images real? Drawing on the video layering techniquesdeveloped in his magisterial Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, this distressed,bleeding assemblage is something like Godard's bid for a Guernica\u2014avisceral and formally brilliant evocation of total war.As in Dante, Hell is a tough act to follow. \"Reporters always visit thehells, and tourists the paradises! One seldom goes to purgatory,\"Godard told. But Sarajevo is a former hell that attracts a particularkind of tourist. JLG appears as his rumpled self to give a talk at aFrench-sponsored literary conference; other participants includeSpanish novelist Juan Goytisolo, Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, anda fictional Israeli journalist (Sarah Adler) carrying a copy ofLevinas's Entre Nous. Like him, she's concerned with building bridges.So is Godard, although his mainly have to do with metaphor and montage.Despite the absence of Bosnian-speaking subjects, Notre Musique takesas its ruling metaphor Mostar's Stari Most, the stone bridge thatoutlived the Ottomans and withstood two world wars until it waspulverized by Croatian artillery in 1993. But Bosnia mostly serves as abackdrop for the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, or Jewsand themselves. Godard's translator, the son of a Jewish-EgyptianCommunist, has come to Sarajevo to meet his Israeli niece Olga (NadeDieu). Not only named for but sounding like a 19th-century Russianheroine, she tells him (in French) that she's contemplating a form ofsuicide to protest the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.The heart of the movie is Godard's lecture (a disquisition on theethics of montage) and its failure: Hilariously uncertain that he hasmade his point regarding the (mis-)recognition of the Other, heorchestrates a pan across his expressionless audience. Olga, offscreen,asks how DV mini-cameras might affect the future of cinema. Godardstares impassively for a long minute. The oracle is speechless,although Notre Musique, it should be noted, is shot largely in 35mm andcharacterized by an austere, Calvinist beauty. The colors are saturatedand the contrast pronounced, with figures typically silhouetted againsta bright background. The editing is dense. A second viewing shows Olgarepeatedly glimpsed on the streets of Sarajevo.However madly aphoristic, filled with close-ups, and populated byserious young women, this is one of Godard's more documentary films;given his programmatic perversity, he keeps stressing the importance offiction, fable, and icon. The haunting final movement takesself-martyred Olga to a paradise that, despite the presence of U.S.Marines, strongly resembles the same Swiss landscape where Godard shothis last meditation on the Balkan wars, For Ever Mozart.Too touchy-feely for some hardcore Godardians, Notre Musique is themost lucid of the master's recent films. More gnarly Godard may befound in Moments Choisis des Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma. An 85-minutedistillation of his fin de si\u00e8cle magnum opus, the five-hour,eight-part video Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, the heavily encoded Moments isanother installation in Godard's long goodbye. The artist merges filmand video as well as painting and cinema. Earnest stars rush the cameraamid a flickering thaumascope effect. Moments might be an Oscar-nightclip-fest doc transmitted from an unknown galaxy.Not half a dozen menhave ever been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in theirheads. Godard is one of them.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Notre musique (2004)Recent Posts (updated daily)Usermeaning of the title ?bettinay-1godard discussion groupgloria.montiMusic in Musiquejnhiller2003Pictures from Heaven sectionzikanovPan + Scan DVD?GabrielValleymoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:11'09''01 - September 11The BeachThe Mambo KingsBenny's VideoGuerrerosIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

These are without doubt the best liveperformances i have ever seen. The first concert was Stevie Ray's firstappearance at the Montreux jazz were the crowd showered him in boo'sand hisses. Even though the crowd didn't think so the concert wasamazing and proved to be one of his most important concerts. The secondconcert was even better. The crowd were now familiar with Stevies musicand greeted him with the respect and reception that he deserved. If youare a fan of guitar music, blues or rock then you will love the uniquestyle of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Its just a pity that he died so soon.

Kilmer is very good in here, one of hisbest performances ever and the film is nicely photographed. The onlywarning I would give viewers is the language, which contains about 25f-words.The best plug I can give this film is that it was very entertaining,start to finish, and that's what most of us are looking for -entertainment. It keeps your attention the full 100-plus minutes, sowhat's not to like? As mentioned, Kilmer is very, very good in hereand, make no mistake: he's the show. Everything in the story reallyrevolves around him.There was anything that struck a sour note with me, it would be thestory with the kidnapped girl's father. I don't think he was realistic,but I won't say more in fear of spoiling anything for those who haven'tseen this.Nonetheless, an under-publicized excellent film of 2004.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Spartan (2004)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserBlanks?superrjonProblems with this film - and there are many (spoilers)bobbykivistikSoundtrackneoengel127Whooaaaaa - Pleasantly SuprisedcoffeefilterSalton Sea reference?Nick_Dets6.8???roca_sta69moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Road HouseAlong Came a SpiderBasicThe Da Vinci CodeThe Sum of All FearsIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The great soundtrack's now been out on CD for a few years; the theme wasproduced by the Pet Shop Boys and sung by authentic 60's icon DustySpringfield.All other songs chosen charted during the early 60's, givingthe film the ring of authenticity.And due possibly to legal problems, theoriginal performance of Chubby Checker's THE TWIST couldn't be used, soChecker re-recorded it for this film.This newer, punchy 1989 version isthe one used today behind Pantene shampoo commercials.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Scandal (1989)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserBridget Fonda with a British accentXenaUKOne of the best films ever and a missing scenedani_mckinleyAvailable on DVD?debyhelenShe wears a red ribbon and a huli huli skirt...devilsmercy03U.K Dvd???powderbluemoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:The Draughtsman's ContractLady Caroline LambLet Him Have ItNineteen Eighty-FourThe Last SeptemberIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

She can also quote Latin tags andShakespeare with colloquial ease.The stuffy head of the firm, Mr. Pym,isplayed by Peter Pratt, well known to Gilbert & Sullivan buffs as the comiclead at the D'Oyly Carte several generations ago.The ubiquitous Peter Bowles plays the villainous Major Milligan as adopedealer to the \"bright young things\" who still knows when to apologize forrudeness. Mark Eden continues his role as Chief Inspector Parker, nowWimsey's brother-in-law since marrying into the family after the \"CloudsofWitness\" case. If I cannot warm up to Lady Mary (Rachel Herbert), it isperhaps because of her smugness that tries to be charming but (for me)justmisses.Possibly the best realized character is Bridget Armstrong's Dian deMomerie, the fading sexpot who knows she is doomed by her associates, herdrug taking, and the ravages of time. Armstrong turns what could have beenan utterly cliched role into a sympathetic and believableone.And of course, Ian Carmichael is the same bubbling amateur sleuth ofthefirst two mysteries, always ready to apologize for forgetting he hasadvantages over most of the others.The plot combines a simple whodunit with a complex howsitdun; and ifyoupay close attention to the most seemingly inconsequential lines in thefirstepisodes, you will appreciate all the more the solution in the last one. Iwill reveal none of the plot here, except to say it is a lot offun.The production budget is below that of the Poirot series, but theperiodfeel is just as good. By the way, when Wimsey (in disguise) is comparedwithBertie Wooster, the script writer might be indulging in an inside joke:IanCarmichael did play Wooster in a series on British TV and that associationnearly cost him getting Wimsey after he himself suggested it to the powersthat be!Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \"Murder Must Advertise\" (1973) (mini)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\"The Nine Tailors\"Secret AgentAn Unsuitable Job for a Woman\"Cadfael\"\"Inspector Morse\"IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It justnever lets up, and it has Stallone at the top of his game. Its comic stripstuff, and is much less credible than First Blood. I don't care about thatthough, you want a serious film then watch The Deer Hunter or Platoon, butif you want to see a superbly made action film watch this. After the eventsof First Blood, John Rambo is in prison but gets released to be sent back toVietnam to take pictures of a pow camp to get proof that there is stillAmerican pow's there. But he is double-crossed by his superiors when hetries to take some pow's out with him, he wasn't meant to do that, he wasordered to only take photos, so he's left behind to be captured , imprisonedand tortured by those oh so nasty RUSSIANS! Sly really had it in for thereds in 1985 after this film, he sent Rocky out to Russia to beat up thatother nasty Russian Ivan Drago! It must have been what the people wanted asthis and Rocky IV were two of the biggest smashes of the year. StevenBerkhoff plays the Russian bad guy in practically a carbon copy of his rolein the James Bond film Octopussy, he does it well though, he was one ofHollywoods favourite bad guys of the mid 80's, you might remember him inBeverly Hills Cop, which was a film initially intended for........SylvesterStallone!

They drive me up a wall. Same withromance books. But perhaps because this was romantic in a weird way, Idid really like it.Swain plays a down-and-out white trash girl in Virginia, married to acreep named Edgar who robs stores to keep themselves afloat. They don'tgive you a background as to why she ever married this creep, but thebloom has worn off the rose and she just wants to get away from himnow.She's in love with a very pale young man who is a lawyer in their smallSouthern town. He's a big fish in a small pond and more to offer herthen she's ever seen in her whole white trash life.Edgar also has a best friend, a guy named \"Flowers\", for what reason Ican't imagine, who hangs around Edgar and his wife all the time.Flowers is infatuated with Inez, Edgar's wife, but she finds himrepulsive. He really is, at first--you have to look hard through allthe dirt and bad clothing and beard to recognize pretty nice-lookingAri Verveen.Edgar knows Inez is in love with someone else and after a fight,decides to keep her prisoner in her own house by chaining her to herbed at night and to the sofa daily, with Flowers standing guard whileEdgar goes and does whatever it is he does.Inez manages to convince Flowers to help her to get away from Edgar bymurdering him for her. He doesn't really need a lot of convincing,since he wants her for himself.These people are completely amoral and trashy, but there is still abeautiful kind of poetic romance to Flower's love for Inez. I loved themovie.

Ihad high hopes for Hypercube but i didn't expect it to be as good or betterthan the first. I think people would enjoy it more if they didn't expectunreasonable expectations for this one.Hypercube has some flaws, but it is still entertaining. If you love Scienceand Physics (like i do), then you will love some of the questions this filmproposes.I liked the darker feel of the first film more so than Hypercube. The\"Cubes\" in this one are basically very bright white and it is sometimes veryintrusive to the eyes. I also would have liked less characters in this one.One thing that worked so well in Cube 1 were the interesting characters andthe fact that there were not many in the film at all. This doesn't alwayswork in most films, but it worked perfectly in Cube 1.If there was one thing which i really did not like in Hypercube, it wouldhave to be the ending. It was very cheesy and way over the top. It seemedlike an episode of The X Files, which works just fine for a Sci-fi TVseries, but it just didn't work here.So, is Hypercube worth viewing? Yes it is, simply because some viewers willlike it more than others. It is still a better movie than most of the Sci-fimovies that have been released lately.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)The \"Fools\" are good, only the \"Chain\" is broken, 3 July 2005Author:Barky44 (brewpub44@snet.net) from United States\"Chain of Fools\" is one of those zany ensemble-cast spoofs on crimefilms. The \"Fools\" include Selma Hayek as a Playboy-posing policesergeant; Steve Zahn as an incompetent barber; Jeff Goldblum as ageneric stylish thug; Elijah Wood as the world's youngest hit man;David Cross as an overgrown Boy Scout (literally); Tom Wilkinson as avengeful wealthy industrialist; Orlando Jones as a beefy transvestite;and Lara Flynn Boyle as a treacherous ex-wife.Normally I love ensemble films, and this particular one had a greatcast (well, Steve Zahn didn't particularly shine in this film, eventhough he has the most screen time). The problem with CoF is the partsaren't strung together that well. The plot is mediocre, the editing ishaphazard and the story doesn't flow too well at moments.But the characters do provide quite a few laughs themselves.

Though he's totallyunrecognizable with a long beard, Stallone does an exceptionally goodperformance because unlike his other cop roles, such as Ray Tango from\"Tango and Cash\", Sly doesn't portray a cocky character, which makes it veryrealistic. However, our hero doesn't show his muscles in this flick, but, itproves that you don't have to be brawny to be a tough guy.Hauer is also perfect, playing what he does best, an oily villian. He mightlook very suave at first in this film, but when he shows his true colors,you better watch out. Last but not least is Billy Dee Williams, who does acool Roger Murtaughesque cop who relies on his partner Sly to do thejob.If you're in the mood for suspense and good chase scenes, \"Nighthawks\" isyour gameplan. Look out for the great conclusion.

The drug king's top security man, Mike Marshak (Sam Elliott), takes ashine to Rita, although we aren't sure why. I spent the entire film thinkinghe might be an undercover cop -not so. Had it been any other actor besidesElliott I think this flaw might have prevented the film from beingbelievable. But Elliott, and his cool, understated style just swept me awaywith his obvious attraction to Rita.

Hershey is a batty broad whoAndrews, a taxi driver, picks up in Manhattan one night. She wants to hirehim to take her to the desert. Thus begins one of the worst road movies I'veseen in years. Why these two people would even talk after spending 48 hourstogether, let alone become romantically involved is beyond me. Their firstlovemaking is one of the most ridiculous scenes of it's type. The film'sonly redeeming value comes from the performance of John Doe, as a friendly,helpful local in the town where the two leads ultimately wind up.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Drowning on Dry Land (1999)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Animals and the TollkeeperMidnight RunThelma & LouiseRat RaceSherryBabyIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)Fantastic Factory: Second assault, 2 December 2001Author:Hellraiser-1 from Cartagena,SpainAfter \"Faust\" the producers Julio Fern\u00e1ndez and Brian Yuzna together withdirector Jack Sholder decided to offer us one of those typical monstersmovies normally direct to video although in this case, obviously it wasreleased at the theaters. The film was very well advertised in TV butunfortunately it was a complete flop at the box office(Less than 50millionpesetas for more than 100 copies), but despite that and even recognizingthat it is a quite weak movie I prefer this to the mentioned \"Faust\". Theplot is typical but at least it has more sense and less holes thanFantasticFactory\u00b4s first movie and the acting was also a bit better, so peopledidn\u00b4tlaugh at the theater(In \"Faust\" as I said they were frequently doingso).For\"Arachnid\" I think that the producers had a clearer idea of what theywantedto do, a typical B movie similar to those B fantastic movies that Filmaxhasbeen distributing in video during all its existence something like\"Spiders\"or \"Crocodile\" with sometimes bad special effects and where the job bySholder is far from being so inspired as in \"Hidden\" or \"A nightmare onElmStreet 2\" but nevertheless the film has some good points and Sholder getsone memorable scene about the killing of a guy by a group of mutant tickswhich is the best of the movie and which is, no doubt, the best goricscenethat I have seen lately.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Arachnid (2001)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserJust saw on Sci-Fi, and the end...?ops_ktWhat in the world?lumpywumpkinsmoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Cannibal HolocaustAnacondas: The Hunt for the Blood OrchidKing KongKing KongThe Mysterious PilotIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Except for being black, this couple who move into a hauntedhouse are strictly by-the-numbers characters, as is what happens to them.Special effects are primitive, without even camp value. There are sexscenesand nudity but nothing special about them. Our horny ghost is about asinteresting as a third-rate strip show.

I wanted moreofthe same kind of entertainment. This movie was very disappointing. Itseemsto happen a lot with me in terms of Hong Kong movies; I run into a greatone, then when I look into the other movies the star and/or directormade,90% of them suck.The movie starts off getting me excited, with Stephen Chow in a prison.Thenit goes to this other guy for the next ten or so minutes straight andRUINSthe entire experience. Its the kind of movie you start watching leaningforward, but soon have your hand on your chin in boredom. This is about1%of the entertainment value of Shaolin Soccer. This other guy, Nicksomething, has no talent and has no ability to entertain. I think he'spretty popular over in Asia, but outside the area and all the hype, wherewejust see him as an actor, it is easy to tell how much hesucks.What's the matter with the script. It just cuts back and forth fromrandomscene to random scene, and all of it is boring! If you want to make arandomstyle movie, it can be extremely funny if done correctly. This was not.ITIS BORING. Why do many Asian films think they can do the same joke overandover for decades? Like the man running on the beach in slo-mo, Baywatchstyle. It was funny a million years ago when it was stillnew.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chin wong ji wong 2000 (1999)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Mr. LuckySing si lip yanJeuk singBai ga jaiNgo dik yeh man tung hokIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Yes, my parents were asleep and wewe're the first kids on my block to get cable. So yes, I tip toed downstairsin the middle of the night to watch this movie. I don't know what the adultsthough of this film, but all I knew, was this woman got naked in front of achild. Not only that, but sex followed! For being the only eight year-old inthe room, I wasn't about to change the channel to watch cartoons. I guessyou can say this was a coming of age drama if not a sad black comedy aboutsex, relationship, and finding sex and a relationship in the most unlikelyplaces. All in all, I remember the movie (at such a young age) because ofthe subject matter. The overall story of the movie? Couldn't tell you. Iwasn't listening to anything the actors were saying.

Sharon Stone... anyone could have played her part, andshe acted as if she was proving just that. She looked good doing it, nosurprise.

Thisis not really a comedy per se, as there is a dramatic element to it,and the performances should not be so easily dismissed.Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together; Keanu is notplaying a superficial action role, so the focus is not on him. This isa good thing, especially as we can then appreciate Charlize Theron'sperformance as Sara Deaver, a quirky girl who Nelson (Keanu) meets atthe DMV in San Francisco. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop- thepositive aspects of it are emphasized, and it becomes another characterin the film.Jason Isaccs plays Chaz Cherry, the local cross-dresser who is Theron'sfriend and confidante. He does well in this, and last night I actuallysaw him in \"Friends With Money\", wherein his talent was literallywasted. Liam Aiken portrays Abner, who is quasi-adopted by Theron andReeves, as their relationship develops.There are some funny scenes, like where Greg Germann (Reeves' co-workerat an ad agency) orders cappuccino and is told off by the waitress.Also where Reeves is presenting an ad campaign for hot dogs, and heeventually flips out.The film works because it is not a gushing romance film; I am not a bigfan of Reeves but he was very good in this film. Theron was excellent,as always, and there are some beautiful shots of the Bay in SanFrancisco, a nice backdrop for a bittersweet romance.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sweet November (2001)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserThe ending made me crysst1987Autumn in NYLaney_girl08Keanu singingrosie_rouShe doesn't die.nicholassixx'take the 80 to Oakland'nam-turkwhat is ernie!??krxy04moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:SabrinaThe Other SisterHere on EarthBeachesJerry MaguireIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I bought SleepoverNightmare because it was filmed at my favorite performer's house. Butit's an okay movie. I'm glad most of the gore was implied rather thanexplicitly shown! Same for the sex scenes. And the characters at leastshowed some sense by sticking together once they realized what washappening.It did seem odd that the party ended so early and most of the kids leftso soon, but I suppose that was necessary so more attention could befocused on the main characters.A question though - don't Canadian cars have airbags, especially thepolice cars? All those car crashes and not one airbag deployed? Give mea break!

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-Not THAT bad, 31 July 2006Author:MissTRious from m/s Seven Seas MarinerSo before I start this comment a couple of pieces of information....Firstly, I am a Ben Browder fan so not only saw but purchased this filmfor this reason and secondly, even before I clicked the purchase buttonon Amazon I read the comments already listed on this site.I would like to say that although it would never win any Oscars, on thewhole this was not that bad a film.C. Thomas Howell, one of my favourite 80's stars, does not look good inthis movie I have to admit. At times he looked more like a strangulatedJim Carrey doing one of his goofy faces. His acting was not the best Ihave to admit, although I have to say in his defence that the story wasquite preposterous at points (especially the whole idea of him justjumping in his BMW and tootling down to the wrong side of the tracks tofind out answers!)Sean Young is of very little consequence really. Aside from lookinggood (and naked for about .05 of a second) she is ignored on the whole.DeeDee Pfeiffer's role could have been expanded but as it is was leftpretty two dimensional.As for Ben Browder, his was actually quite a pivotal role and aided thestory twists, but again was under utilised.I have to say the worst culprit of the whole movie was the story. Itwas very slow in places dragging its feet over unnecessary elements andthen suddenly making great leaps across other plot features. However, even though it was no \"Usual Suspects\" (the only film increation to keep me guessing until the last second, no mean feat I cantell you) it had some nice twists and the ending was explained well (Ihate half-endings).Overall, if I saw this coming on TV I would watch it again, and I feelthat I have made a worthwhile (if a little frivolous) purchase fromAmazon.My final two thoughts are:Firstly, re: the extras on the DVD, DON'T bother with the deletedscenes and DO listen to what Brad and Ben say in their interview! Theytell you NOT to watch the interview before the movie as they give awaya MAJOR plot feature (I did not heed their advice and so fell foul ofthis fact!)and secondly, it is so strange to hear Ben swear. Never could quite getused to it :-)Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for A Killer Within (2004)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserWorst movie Everchivas480Interpreting 2 sentencesPiranianRose****spoiler*** Dr Pepperroger565whos that girl durin the vargas interrogation scene??maximuz20032003The magnetsbiohazard12589Anyone Know Anything About this Movie?thehistorymajormoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Entre las piernasIn PursuitPretty PersuasionSacrificeAfflictionIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)22 out of 22 people found the following comment useful:-A truly classic Russian comedy, 10 April 2002Author:George Freedman (geosochi@yahoo.com) from Glendale, CaliforniaThis is my favorite Russian comedy, and although it is 30 years old, peoplestill enjoy it more than most other comedies today. A satiric and wittymovie that revolves around an adventurous plot. The plot is basically thataconvict (Dotsent) escapes from prison and the militia (Russian police) findthe criminal's lookalike, a kindergarten teacher. He goes undercover andpretends to be a criminal to help the militia find the where the realconvict has hidden a stolen mask. He makes a phony escape from the prisonwith two others, who think he is the real Dotsent. He eventually befriendswith them and they become attached, but I won't reveal the rest. From myplot review it might seem as a violent movie or something like that, butactually it is good for the entire family. The movie is entertainingthroughout and if you want to see a comparison with an American equivalent,it's like a lot like Seinfeld because it's a situational comedy. If you area fan of Russian cinematography and haven't seen this one, watch it rightaway because this is a true classic with some of the greatest Russianactors(see cast).Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gentlemeny udachy (1972)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of FearBal-Can-CanSreda obitaniyaThe Whole Town's TalkingMiminoIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)1 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-A lesson in irritation!, 4 March 2006Author:Guitar_84688 from Guelph, Ontario, CanadaI recently rented a copy of this 1968 TV special on VHS. When I foundthat copy, I had never even heard of the special before. But it caughtmy attention because I'm a big Monty Python fan and saw John Cleese onthe front cover. So I looked at the back, and it looked like a comedypiece that I would want to see. So I rented it. When I watched it, Iwasn't disappointed. There are some mildly lame moments, but for themost part, it's very funny. How To Irritate People is a mockumentary, pretending to be aneducational program. Narrated by John Cleese, it shows several sketchesthat are supposed give viewers instructions on how to irritate people,in various situations! Of course, these things should not be tried inreal life, and this whole thing was only made for entertainment.This special came out the year before the legendary comedy team MontyPython started out with their hit TV series, Monty Python's FlyingCircus. It features three Pythons. That of course includes John Cleese,and the two others are the late Graham Chapman, along with MichaelPalin. The humour in this special is basically the same style of humourthat Monty Python was always known for, so if you don't like that, thenthere's obviously no point in watching this. I probably didn't have totell you that. But if you're a Monty Python fan, just like me, then Iwould say that How To Irritate People is worth watching. It may notquite match Monty Python's best work, but it comes close enough.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for How to Irritate People (1968) (TV)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:The War Against Terror: The MusicalWaiting for GuffmanDouglasShakespeare in... and OutThis Is Spinal TapIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

His self deprecating style is simply perfect andextraordinarily funny.I have seen this show several times on cable and I laugh often and outloudthroughout every time. The opening 20 minutes have some of the funnieststuff I have ever heard particularly the bits about his relationships.Andhis description of Jim Brown trying to save him from crack addiction andthestories of his subsequent hospitilization for burn treatment arehilarious.Highly recommended.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip (1982)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Richard Pryor ...Here and NowRichard Pryor: Live in ConcertRichard Pryor: Live and Smokin'Eddie Murphy RawEddie Murphy DeliriousIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

People do not know what LaGuardia HSis until I mention that it's the \"Fame\" school. In my four years ofbeing a student there, I did not watch \"Fame\". In fact, I just saw it 4days ago. There are two teachers from the movie that currently teach atLaGuardia, Penny Frank and Jim Moody.There were some things that did not connect, obviously. For instance,you would never do pointe freshman year. It captured the student'sspirits very well, however we never broke into song and dance duringlunch, we were too busy eating!! Some people will have theirinstruments and jam a bit in the lunchroom or senior lounge. In betweenbreaks, the dance majors are still in their leotards grabbing lunch.Music majors have blackout days, where they come into school directlyinto the concert hall and not class and rehearse all day. What I domiss about the school is seeing people cut class to hang out in thehallway and work on their harmonies. Figuring out math problems whiledown the hall, a class would be studying their new Italian aria.I did not feel as if the movie was amazing. In terms of capturing thespirit of the students, it was incredible. The struggles that all thestudents went through was definitely a reality. There were many thingsleft out in the movie, especially the endings of various situationsbetween the students.I miss LaGuardia though. Never will I go to a school like that withpeople as interesting. I'm in college now and haven't really foundpeople interesting enough to stimulate my mind.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)2 out of 4 people found the following comment useful:-A truly bad sequel, 10 February 2005Author:kwheeley from United StatesWhy can't Hollywood just let good movies die in peace? This 2nd sequelto the original and quite good \"Smokey and the Bandit\" stinkseverywhere. The story is lame and the characters have been reduced tocaricatures of themselves.Let's start with the story. The premise here is that those Enos boysare at it again, wanting to have some fun at the expense of someone.That someone is none other than Sheriff Buford T. Justice (insertJackie Gleason's distinct, Southern lispy drawl) who has just put infor retirement. When those retirement plans aren't what they originallyseemed, our valiant Sheriff accepts the Enos' challenge: Deliver aplastic shark to the new restaurant the Enos boys opened up. Whilealong the way, those rascally Enos dudes are going to try to stop himat any cost.Okay, stop right there. In the first Bandit movie, the idea was asimple challenge and bet. The Enos boys were depicted as nothing morethan a rich father and son team who were bored so they thought up agood challenge. No real maliciousness involved - just a challenge withsome money put up to make people take it seriously. That was fun.In the 2nd Bandit movie, the Enos reputation (such as it is) is on theline and they want to beat a political rival. Not as strong, but again,nothing terribly malicious involved. This movie has them just trying to be mean to their new play toy.Namely, Sheriff Justice. So they send him on his way and start tryingto sabotage his trip. When Justice beats them at every turn, theyfigure that they need a professional to deal with him. Since the Banditisn't around (he's off making \"Stroker Ace\") they give the job (and thered shirt, belt buckle and hat) to Cledus, our old truck driving buddy.So, Cledus chases Justice to get the prized shark and fun and laughterensue. Well, not too much fun and little laughter but look on thebright side - it was a paycheck for Gleason and Reed. Anyway, from there on out it becomes the now tired old cat-and-mousegame with one side giving chase to the other. But even the chases lackthe polish to make you remember back to the ones in the 1977 original.They seem more staged and one dimensional. For example, there's a scenewhere Cledus and a new buddy \"sneak\" up from behind and take the sharkoff of the Sheriff's car. The shot is not technically difficult andit's rather boring. Plus, what law enforcement officer doesn't checkhis mirror to make sure of what's behind him? I learned that in 11thgrade driver's ed.Anway, to summarize, I think the use of the 1982 (anemic) Trans Am isallegorical to the rest of the cast: It's got the right name but isunder-thought, underpowered and basically is just a diluted version ofits former self.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983)Recent Posts (updated daily)Userfunny moviemrolympia_123Gator KicksrolykeatesThe sand PlantrolykeatesDid anyone here see the original version.MasterPain_2EditingID already takenanyone else notice..jnoble11moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Smokey and the Bandit IISmokey and the BanditThe Cannonball RunThelma & LouiseSpeed Zone!IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It doesn't show in \"Funny Face\" either, but her natural gamineappeal does seem to get swallowed up in the fake-happy surroundings.The Oscar-nominated screenplay about a famous photographer discoveringa beauty in a mousy Greenwich Village book-clerk is only good in itsearly stages setting up the story, but when we find that the plot isjust a romance complication, it's a let-down. The plot-thread about thephilosopher in Paris is dire, and the film laughably compares a beatniklecture to a spiritual, but Hepburn works hard to create chemistrybetween she and Fred Astaire (older and less enthused) and she has somefeisty, enchanting moments. She does her own singing here, unlike inthe later \"My Fair Lady\" (which coincidentally also gave Audrey afashionable makeover), and her dancing is sprightly and fun. It's afluttery, gay, fashion-magazine movie without enough soul in it toreally be absorbing, but the Gershwin songs are sweet and theeye-popping color-schemes give it a great visual kick. ** from ****Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Funny Face (1957)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserWhy is 'Funny Face' loved??classics4meThe Clothescrazygirl2306Great Audrey Film..calisaFake romancevinum90035Who choreographed what?

An unusual film, at least for its time. Astylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music.The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creatinga sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told.The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever reallywant it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent,and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget,the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The actingis top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, thisis no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel,Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well,let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course,of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk TillDawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen himact, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-makermyself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I canrelate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you justneed to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still,that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at leasttwo fairly big characters that seem completely and entirelyexpendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, veryeasily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won'tname them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'mtalking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and theiractions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing...something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhatdrawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comesto direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is verywell put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-linetelling the story far better than a \"regular\" film ever could. One ofthe many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talkedme into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someoneediting films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc.- so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirelyrespect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that theirdoing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way...but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told liesin the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something theway the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make yourown version and pass it off as anything but just that... your ownversion, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just needto comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great.Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and usedthem great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very littlekeeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. Irecommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likestheir films with a side of style. 8/10Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Reservoir Dogs (1992)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserAlternate themes?Shepherd_SoccerOpening scenejmmycsnvThe balloon SPOILERSteve_KaczynskiWhite whispers something to Orange?donmichaelKQuestion (Spoilers)elmexicano508moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Pulp FictionThe DepartedCidade de DeusScarfaceKill Bill: Vol. 1IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

At first sight, this movie does not look very differently from theother action or horror flicks I saw recently. However, it has a quality andcoherence that is not usual for movies in its class. Without any known namein the cast, with a low budget and according to some of the critics in only19 days, director Richard Gale succeeded to make a very decent movie. Hishand is sure, his cut is professional, and the movie might have beenlow-cost for the producers, but never looks cheap. I also think thatsomething deeper about the American gun culture is trespassing the screen. Iexpect nice surprises from this director in the future. 7/10 on my personalscale.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Pressure (2002)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Black PointExtreme PrejudiceMarshal LawKnockaround GuysDesert SaintsIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

But as i work in blockbusters, iget free rentals every week so thought i might as well rent it out.Man, was i in for a shocker!! Talk about totally hilarious.Some of the gags in this film were quality - Robin Williams is at hiscomical best. I'm not saying it's Williams' best ever film (cough goodwill hunting cough) but certainly he's never been this funny. His gagabout the abnormally shaped cookie was so funny. In fact, i've neverlaughed this much since Dumb and Dumber.Edward Norton was actually very believable as the clean cut good guy. Ididn't expect it from him after watching Fight club and Americanhistory X but he carried out his role really well.Catherine Keener also looked really beautiful, she played herpower-hungry turned nice chick character to a tee.Even though the story is about a kids show, there's a lot of darkcomedy in it e.g. the involvement of the Irish gangsters (by the wayalso very funny) showing what a good job Danny devito has donedirecting this film. Credit to him. All the characters in the filmserved a purpose and above all, did it well!! All seemed believable andRobin Williams was the star.If you watch this film, persevere for the first 20 minutes becauseafter which the jokes and plot come in hard and thick.Top stuff, rent if you want a comedy with original storyline and alittle bit of good humoured smut thrown in for good measure.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Death to Smoochy (2002)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIMEwolver12345Yahoogroups new Edward Norton group!IamTammyP'Hard Times for Haggis?'

Everyone should know that,specially while watching Airplane 2. In my opinion, Airplane 2 still has thesame quality of humor as Airplane does and it only repeats a few jokes. Itnever seemed repetitive for me, but maybe for most people it can get old tosee two movies with the exact same type of humor and the same type ofuniverse and imagery. I thought it was really funny that they went intospace this time, and they could have done a lot more science fiction movierelated jokes, but they didn't, and I suppose that's okay. I didn't expectit to be as good as the first one, really. Of course the first one wasbetter, but I wouldn't say it was much better. I've seen much worse sequelsfor comedy movies.I personally thought it did fine as a sequel and I'd recommend it to anyonewho liked the first one.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserTrivia wrongWing_nutWhich Airplane! movie is this line from?firestongueCould this movie have been rated PG-13......wasn't it originally R?mwpleftyI don't mean to sound forward womancamerabugsJive TalkingkcuberSo much better than -insert genre- Movierwood-10moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Airplane!Thumb Wars: The Phantom CuticleSpaceballsThe AmbushersRobinson Crusoe of Clipper IslandIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Alan Cumming's 'NightCrawler' was arevelation and the subtext of accepting homosexuality/being a latentMutant was beyond great. The coming out seen with iceman and his familyis phucking exceptional and Wolverine claiming he's their art teacherwas perfect comedy. The brian cox character was greatly cast as was theever so phucking beautiful Kelly Hu...The opening of this film set the tone and the movie took off runningand never once slowed down. Seeing Bryan and his crafty ways ofrevealing characters from future films by threading them in wasseamless and eloquent.

But SE7EN it ain't..., 15 April 2004Author:Freedomisanillusion from Tasmania, AustraliaDespite my love of Angelina Jolie, I must say that Taking Lives wasteda lot of good opportunity.Given that they invented an entirely new lead character, we can'treally compare this to the book, so let's look at it as a movie of it'sown right.Jolie plays Illeana Scott, a somewhat strange FBI agent who is calledup to Canada to investigate the grisly murders of several young men,all whom have had their identities stolen by the killer. New to thescene is witness James Costa, Ethan Hawke, who soon grows to have anattachment to Scott.At turns formulaic and down right rip off (the credits are far toosimilar to be called a homage to SE7EN), Taking Lives is a veryenjoyable piece of work.Beautifully shot, the film wallows in its moods. It knows that it canbe creepy, but it wears it out on its sleeves.Angelina is on top form as Scott, although its a shame that the moviedoes stoop to the need for quick-sex-scene-with-unnecessary-titty-shot.Ethan Hawke is bearable as Costa, although he and Jolie have verylittle chemistry.Other players, Olivier Martinez, Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo and JeanHughes-Angalade are also quite good.The film does have its highs: excellent cinematography, creepy sinistermood, two fantastic adrenaline-jump moments that I never saw coming.But it also has one FATAL flaw, and that is that anyone who has seenany piece of film or television before will be able to guess who thekiller is. Still, a fun movie nevertheless.7/10 If you get the chance to see it in the cinema, watch people'sreactions to the 'scissors-scene'. I was amazed to see hoe genuinelyhorrified even the most hardened viewers in my cinema were.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Taking Lives (2004)Recent Posts (updated daily)Userwhy angelina didn't think Ethan wasn't the serial killers at first ?SPOIhonsheung18The PostertarmikosPnBpaul dano?kayte_the_myspace_addictthe sexiest scene of Ang?honsheung18'Love' SceneseewhatimesdoneAm I the only one?????Masked_SuperheromoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Sin CityCopycatAmerican PsychoBasic InstinctIdentityIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

One thingmovies like to add is loads of comedy not realizing that comedy takesaway from an complete impact. However the movie is made so well thateven though I knew who the killer was before I saw the movie, I wasstill shocked in this movie. The three stars have excellent chemistryand sadly weren't paired up again. Bobby Deol is a better actor now,but he wasn't that great in this movie. He has no facial expression anda weak body language. Sad, because his elder brother mastered at facialexpression. Kajol was amazing, and surprisingly was given a very littlechance to act. However, she proves that four scenes can still let hersteal the show. Koirala was excellent. She is given a less meatier rolethan Kajol, but performs very well as she has more scenes. This rolewas not given any recognition, but she looked extremely beautiful, andshe should portray roles like this. Om Puri and Paresh Rawal werebrilliant. Om Puri played an excellent cop, and Paresh Rawal wasmesmerizing. The main flaw was that the songs got in the way. The onlysongs that were portrayed properly were Mere Khabown Mein Tu (In MyDreams Are You), which is a nice song, Yeh Pyar Kya Hai (What is thisLove) which had nice choreography and was nice to watch. The other goodsong was Mushkil Bada Yeh Pyar Hai (The Love is Really Hard) which wasa very long song and got boring. Anyways the movie was nice, and is atreat to watch.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:HeavenChicagoGunaahThe Hard WordLet Him Have ItIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It dealswith some highly unusual people living in some highly unusual houses.After a quick round-robin visit to each house and occupants, that lastsabout ten minutes, we know about as much about these people and theirhouses as we find out in the next hour. We are left with wanting toknow more about how these people came to be in their current situationsand about the history of their houses. For example, the alligator mansays that everything in his house has a sentimental value - then showus some of those things and explain to us what they mean to him.I wanted to see more about the houses themselves - how they are laidout and how the people live in them. The people who live in the oldmissile silo give us a ten second tour of where the rooms are in theirhouse *from above ground,* and that is it for the overview.These people are satisfying some deep emotions through their livingenvironments and I wanted to know more.

They've invalidated theConstitution in the name of fear. Lets hope the majority will wake upand smell the coffee someday. I read the released version of the patriot act, and it is at least whatis depicted in this documentary.Yes, this documentary has spin, but so do school text books.The fact is there is no reason to go without civil liberties forcitizens when very few citizens have ever been detained for terroristactivities using the partriot act.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Unconstitutional (2004) (V)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserGet these clowns out of Washington!YerMommasPajamaHave Gun Will Travelda-9Scary!xrajaWhen will this be on DVD?sokaymangmoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:After SilencePatriot ActsThe Jaundiced EyeAn Honorable CallingStone MountainIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It's not as good as that aforementioned film. A fantasy that long tobe epic, yet falls a tad bit short thanks to sub-par special effects. That'snot to say it's not enjoyable, as it is. Very much so.

Not knowing much aboutLatin America in general, I was not aware of what went on in Haiti -then, and even now. This was such a powerful film portraying JeanDominique, the Haitian journalist who spoke out against successivedictatorships on Radio Haiti. I feel he resembles how Martin LutherKing, in the way he spoke to become the \"voice of the people\" and hisunending passion to pursue freedom, opportunity and human rights forthe Haitian peasantry.I recall one part of the film that caught my attention. The foreignsoldiers scene discussing \"The Battle of Vertieres\" that occurred onNovember 18, 1803. Composed of escaped Haitian slaves form the HaitianRevolutionary Army,demolish Napoleon's Colonial Forces. Here, JeanDominique's father tells him when he's just a young boy seeing soldierspass his house, \"You are from this land, you are not French, you arenot British, you are not American. You are Haitian!\" I feel Dominique'spassion to fight for human rights from the elite were rooted in him byhis father.Dominique stood for the values of open inquiry, justice and freedom.The documentary provides the world with the insight of this fearlessman who wanted to do good in the world. I hope someday his assassinsare found and justice is served.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Agronomist (2003)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserWhat's Your...ANGEL_407Johnathan DemmeRosenKratzsoundtrack?erincmedleyEntertaining, but needs more political contextSurrenderTotoBest movie about a soil and plant scientist ever...PFEKingUrgent Help!!!blanco353moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:The Trials of Henry KissingerAmerican BlackoutThe Real Malcolm XParagraph 175Aleut StoryIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Fassbinder sets the story ofGenet against a theatrical environment, which almost has similar looks as'West Side Story' (The fighting-routines were inspired by the choreographyof Jerome Robbins). This nostalgic background puts the poetical lyricsmoreinto place, as we see the story of a young sailorboy develop andself-destruct. 'Querelle' the sailor is played by Brad Davis and hisperformance is equally as good as in 'Midnight express'.

As one characterplotzes: \"When did eating out become theater?\" The wonderful, winsome multi-ethnic ensemble of mostly New York actors--many born in Brooklyn according to the IMDb--who have done a lot ofTV work are clearly enjoying making a movie as a coordinated team.Danny Aiello has his best, and somewhat similar, role since \"CityHall.\" Many of the references may go over the heads of those West of theHudson or East of the East River, whether to Tribeca (as a newly trendyneighborhood) or Danny Meyer (restaurant entrepreneur). Or even thedigs at Queens as the home of mobsters, which were greeted by silenceby the Queens audience I saw it with.The upstairs/downstairs of the kitchen scrambles vs. the diningpleasures and everyone's personal spices are lots of fun. The actorsplaying obnoxious customers, like Sandra Bernhard, do so with relishbut not overplayed.Keep your palate clear by not looking at the ad campaign or reading thereviews, as I think they give the plot away and I was totally surprisedby the ending, er, the dessert.(originally written 9/29/2001)Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Dinner Rush (2000)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserBest character in movieneilsuggWhat's the game they're playing?entropy-10sound problems?fred-49bathroom hit songbluegrassishWho did the music for this movie?biodmedworth buying?LunarJunk89moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Fly Away BabyIt's Always Fair WeatherGoodfellasA Man BetrayedEast Side KidsIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

In 1987, both of this movie's main futurepremises \u2013 that autonomous, artificially intelligent robotic \"perfectcompanions\" would exist as consumer products by about 2000, and thatAmerica would suffer a partial political collapse in the same decade \u2013were not particularly outlandish.While Cherry 2000 is presently achieving cult film status, it wasoriginally received as a much more conventional SF movie.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Cherry 2000 (1987)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserWho played Elaine a.k.a.

They're brilliantworks.But this is horrifically off the mark.The review of Davies' version of Edith Wharton's *House of Mirth* inthe NY Times said that the movie was more like Charles Dickens thanEdith Wharton. Which is exactly the criticism I had of this movie.These folks are not embodying American Southern farmers, they're actinglike industrial working class people. I can understand and besympathetic to the original story: my people, coming from SouthCarolina & Georgia, had lives very similar to the plot of this movie.Therefore, I could see where this could potentially be a very goodfilm.But nothing gets under my skin like an inability to see beyond one'sown cultural bias...which is the major mistake of the director of thisproduction. If you take the emotions, the gestures, the imagery of thisfilm and put them in an industrial landscape, it would be an OK movie.But having people interact and react this way and have them beingfarmers in the Deep South is bogus, phony and w-a-y off the mark.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)1 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-Winnie in the Doldrums, 11 May 2005Author:theowinthrop from United StatesThis series was a wonderful and unexpected one a quarter century ago.Based on a book of the same name, it traced the missing period ofWinston Churchill's career. Having been a leading figure in politicallife from 1903 to 1929, and risen to such posts as Home Secretary,First Lord of the Admiralty, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchillwas cast adrift when the Tories under Stanley Baldwin lost office tothe Labor Party of Ramsay MacDonald in a general election. For awhileBaldwin and Churchill were sitting next to each other on the frontopposition bench in the House of Commons, but Baldwin was not thathappy about this. He knew that Churchill was a potential Tory rival forleadership, and Baldwin wanted to control those who would succeed himwhile he held power.The series did not quite explain Churchill's weakness here - in 1903,when he first made his name in politics, Churchill was a Tory M.P. Thiswas traditional, because his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, had alsobeen a Tory M.P. But Lord Randolph had been a maverick, who built up ablock of Tories (one was future Prime Minister Arthur Balfour) calledthe Fourth Party, and had done considerable damage to Lord Salisbury'sparty in the 1880s. Lord Randolph did end up as Chancellor of Exchequerin 1887, but a political showdown miscalculation with Salisburyfinished his career (a case of syphilis also ruined it). Winston tookhis father's independence to heart. He announced his rejection of theTory policies of his day, and \"crossed the aisle\" to sit with theLiberal Party. Denounced for his treason to his father's party, Winstonactually rose to power from 1903 to 1923 as a Liberal Party leader. Butin 1916 there was a power struggle between the Liberal Prime Minister(Asquith) and his successor (Lloyd George). Winston sided with LloydGeorge, and this was fine while a complicated half-Liberal/half-Torycoalition existed. But it collapsed in 1922. The following year Winstonannounced his disillusion with Liberal Party politics and crossed backto the Tories. Baldwin accepted it, as Churchill was experienced andsmart. He made him Chancellor of Exchequer in his 1924-1929administration. But Baldwin (as I said) did not trust Churchill.The series never makes this clear, although Baldwin is shown to be asmart politician (Winston later acknowledged that Stanley was the mostformidable politician he ever met). It follows how Baldwin managed formost of the 1930s to manipulate the weakling MacDonald (who split hisparty on a coalition government in 1931) to keep Churchill out of thegovernment, and then to keep him out of the Tory government of 1935-37.Some of this was due to Churchill's own blundering - he opposedBaldwin's willingness to work with Gandhi on eventual Indianindependence, and he supported the pro-Nazi Edward VIII in theabdication crisis. Baldwin left office in 1937, having chosen NevilChamberlain his successor. In retrospect Baldwin was one of Britain'smost successful Prime Ministers, except he could not move as fast as hewanted in rearming in the face of Nazi aggression (he did do what hecould, but the Labour Party and the Tories were not as willing to rearmas he was).Chamberlain would also keep Churchill at bay, but he came acropper dueto Hitler's aggressions and Munich. But Churchill would not be calledback until Britain would return to war in 1939, and would not becomePrime Minister until 1940.The series was fair in showing that Baldwin was a clever politicalmanipulator. And Eric Porter did a marvelous job as Baldwin's righthand man (and successor) Chamberlain, reminding the audience that hadit been a peaceful period Chamberlain would have reformed the Britisheducation system and the tax system. He just was tragically unpreparedto handle Hitler (who indeed was?). Best was Robert Hardy, whoseChurchill was the best ever done dramatically on television. Not onlyhis political miscalculations were shown, but his financial problems,his growing literary work (remember, he won the Nobel Prize forLiterature as a historian), and his family problems with wifeClementine (Sian Philips), who had an affair, and his son Randolph, whowas too undisciplined to have a political career. One hopes the serieswill be shown again someday.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \"Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years\" (1981) (mini)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:GandhiThe Gathering StormThe Last EmperorDisraeliThe Final CutIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)we can hope for better, 5 June 2001Author:xhari_nairx from Oakland, CAI'm always on the look out for American films that actually acknowledge thatthere are more than two races in America.Unfortunately, while YELLOW doesin fact feature Korean Americans, it fails in too many ways.The titleitself is an in-your-face attempt to say \"Hey!! THIS isAsian-Americanism!!!\"The characters seem to have been created to fulfillthe film maker's desire to represent Korean Americans.That's a trap that alot of films about ethnic minorities fall into, but sometimes with skilledwriting that purpose can be fulfilled while still creating characters thatseem real.Not so in this case, and in fact, they characters and storydon't give you any genuine feel for the issues facing Korean Americansanyway.No point in taking the actors to task for their performances... thefinest thespians couldn't make these character's motivations tangible.Thestory suffers from the \"dummy-plot\" syndrome.... there would be no story ifthe characters weren't stupid.The story drifts aimlessly from onecontrived event to another.It eventually reaches such levels ofridiculousness that you're wondering if the film maker just added scenes inbecause it would be fun to shoot.That all being said... Chris Chan Leemight have a good film in him.At times he displays a good visual sense.Maybe if he was working with a writer who could craft a convincing storywith genuine emotion.But unfortunately, YELLOW is a film worth watchingonly if you're writing a term paper on Asian American film.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Yellow (1998)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserAny similar?meis760-1Michael Chungyoungjun91moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Baby It's YouIs It College Yet?My Best Friend's WifeThe Perfect WeaponDo the Right ThingIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Good actors. Sweet tone. Inventivebitsthat echo the spirit of the previous movie. However, I agree with LeonardMaltin on the one flaw: no story. This movie is more or less a collectionsof vignettes, sometimes with little to no connection with each other. Ifthere had been a developing story to hang these vignettes on, we wouldhavegotten a movie very close to the quality of the previous movie. But as itisnow, it's a simple pleasant movie. Even better when you realize the usualquality of sequels.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Wyoming RenegadesDestry Rides AgainThe Three OutlawsThe DeadlineMrs. SundanceIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

One thing I really enjoy in movies from that neck ofthe world is the fact that we're not dealing with professional actorshere. Most of the characters are played by regular Joes and it adds onto the experience. \"Marooned in Iraq\" also shows the daily life of theKurds, being bombarded by Saddam's planes. Interesting look at theculture, at the way of making a living, like at the brick work. As in\"A Time for Drunken Horses\", I was also very moved by the look in thechildren's eyes. The cinematography is also beautiful. And I enjoyedthe traditional music. Rent this one (or get it at your local librarylike I did) and see for yourself Mirza's odyssey. It plays almost likea treasure hunt. One negative note though: I saw the film on DVD and Isuspect that the subtitles didn't really captured what the characterswere saying. Unless Kurds are using 10 words for 1 English or Frenchone, I got robbed of a lot of the dialog. Too bad.Seen at home, in Toronto, on September 16th, 2005.80/100 (***)Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gomgashtei dar Aragh (2002)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Zamani baray\u00e9 masti asbhaNiwe mungDavid & LaylaKilom\u00e8tre z\u00e9roTakht\u00e9 siahIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-A masterpiece !, 26 May 2006Author:wmjahn from AustriaDid anyone notice that Charlie made 2 of his best (maybe his best)pictures one after another, both directed by Michael Winner (who didsome more nice entries in the Bronson catalog), both scored by JerryFiedling (superbly, if I may add), \"CHATO'S LAND\" and \"THE MECHANIC\"(from whom Tarantine chose to quote in \"Kill Bill II\") ??!! I must havewatched both movies app. half a dozen times and they seem to get betterwith every viewing (despite knowing its ending)! First, these are films made for men, not children or family-viewing.And let's be honest, if you wanna see a good, though, well played movietoday, what you're gonna do?? Certainly not go to the cinema, were yousee noisy, trashy high-budget trash in a row. You buy yourself a DVD orwatch some late-night viewing of a 70ies movie on TV! And these twomovies are certainly as good as it can get! Second, these movies are more less silent! You don't hear some sillydialog through it all, but just men saying a few words, when it'sreally needed. Those people, who talk a lot in such movies, are happilythe first ones that gonna be shot (and it's good this way)! Everybody'salways pointing out who little Arnold is saying in \"TERMINATOR\" (ofcourse the first one), a real good movie, too! Well, get yourselfCHATO'S LAND. In the German dubbed version good old Charlie (God blesshim!) spoke less than 10 words in German and maybe another dozen or soin some tribal language, that's it! I'd take a bet that there is mostlikely no other non-silent movie every made, in which the hero says asfew words as in this one!! And while we're at comparing it to Schwarzenegger/Terminator, didanybody notice those MUSCLES of Charlie??!! And these are certainly noanabolic-stuff, but real hard & honest earned ones! If we'd takeCharlie in his prime (when he made this one, he was HALF A CENTURY OLD= 50 years!!!) and compare it to Schwarzenegger, when he was 50 notthat long ago ... I'd say Charlie would have wiped the carpet with him,should there have been any reason for an argument. I'd just wish I'dhave looked that well, when I was 30, not to speak of being 50 (notyet).The guy is just SO COOL in this movie as well as in THE MECHANIC (andmany more in fact))! OK, I hear the critics saying, this is just a \"silly\" revenge-movie(note: made before DEATH WISH I !!). Nope, it ain't !! First, it's notthat important, what the story is, what really counts is how it isdelivered: movie-experts doing what they can at the highest level! It'sjust GREAT to watch them delivering all the expected scenes withoutgetting whimsical, talky or making compromises. This is a men's moviemade for men! And second, it's not stupid at all! Why does everybodyhas to go on his knees in front of authorities (the sheriff)? Esp. ifyou're part of a badly treated minority! He's on his own, when a bigcrowd invades HIS LAND (like the USA did in Vietnam) and he wipes themoff. He knows the land better than everybody else, he's trained andintelligent (the followers are more stupid, but not completely), so hedoes what he has to do. At the end the winner is logical and probablythat's the movie, Mr. Bush should have watched before entering theIraque ...OK, back to the movie. What about the acting? Wooden??? Come on, itain't, it's just perfect for this movie!! Would you like to see somewhat-they-call-\"actor\"-today (say, Adrien Brody, who wasn't tooconvincing in KING KONG either) delivering this?? It would just be\"strange\"/ridiculous. And the other members of the crew? Just perfect!Palance, superb (as always, but he should have avoided City Slickers),Basehart and Whitmore, great! Just the kinda support crew one needs andwhich is simply non-existent today (and which is sadly missed!).One critic complained about the \"cheap look\" (??) of the movie, andthat it must have been inexpensive to make. Well, so what? First,blockbusters suck anyway, every 2 minutes an explosion is just noisyand boring (but obviously expensive) anyway and the scenery is in factsuperbly chosen! It's just THE MAN, the scenery and his doomedfollowers. The land is as bleak as the fate of the followers/hunters.It's empty, it's pure, it's honest, it's something for \"desert-rats\".:-)) So to sum up: you can't chose better for a great action movie ofthe 70ies (and that'w when most of the great actions movies weremade!).Moreless the same can be said about THE MECHANIC: tough, not-talky,thrilling, superbly shot and acted, great support cast, too, and whatan ending !!! I'd LOVE to see these out on DVD with much bonus material(scenes from the set, one of Carlies too rare interviews: well, the guystayed silent when there was not much too say, smile, although I wouldlove him to still be among us and write some great autobiography!)!What a loss, but then again he's hopefully having superb times,wherever he's now!Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chato's Land (1972)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserBRONSON at his best - areal masterpiece!wmjahnApache KidsnoortonWhy had the 2 last guys have to suffer most?

It's an enjoyable movie, non-formulaic and with some good acting. Iparticularly enjoyed Jake Lloyd's performance, which is why I lookedforwardto seeing him as Anakin Skywalker. Boy, all I can say is that directionmustmake a huge difference. He was much stiffer and forced in SW:TPM than inthis movie, in which he was natural and sweet. Worth a rental just to seehow talented this kid actually is.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Unhook the Stars (1996)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserHow does it end?

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-Virtuoso performance, 21 April 2002Author:Duncan Gowers from London, United Kingdom\"The Song Remains The Same\" is essentially a film of a concert, yet thanksto the drug and ego-addled personalities of Led Zeppelin in the mid-1970s,the footage is fleshed out to include weird 'fantasy' sequences involvingeach of the four band members.While this section of the movie leaves alittle to be desired, the concert footage is truly breathtaking, capturingthe greatest hard rock band in history at their apogee.The film opens with an odd gangster-style sequence, where faceless mobstersare mowed down by what would appear to be rival gangsters.Whatever meaningthis scene is meant to represent is not clear, however it has been suggestedthat the faceless mobsters are the British press, who had vilified LedZeppelin through their entire career.Who knows, but it certainly makes foran interesting start to the film.From there the film takes an interesting turn.Each individual band memberis introduced.We see drummer John Bonham ploughing his fields in atractor, bassist John Paul Jones reading nursery rhymes to his children,singer Robert Plant playing with his wife and children in an English countrylake (the scene resembles the cover of Led Zeppelin's 1973 album 'Houses ofthe Holy'), while guitarist Jimmy Page is introduced next to a riverside.They each receive a letter informing them that they are to tour the nextday.Once Led Zeppelin take the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden, theaction really begins.The band run through some of their absolute classics,including 'Whole Lotta Love', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Heartbreaker' and amassive version of 'Dazed and Confused'.The quality of musicianship isamazing.Page's guitar playing belies belief and John Bonham's twentyminute drum solo is awe inspiring.As the band plays there are more fantasyscenes, the best of which includes Robert Plant as some kind of Arthurianhero.The way in which Led Zeppelin embrace and play on the Tolkien-likeworld of mystical fantasy is truly refreshing in these over-stylised days,where musicians are more concerned with the amount of gel in their hair thanthe music they produce.Watching the band at work you get a distinct feeling that the musicians oftoday really aren't as proficient as they were twenty or thirty years ago.Led Zeppelin it seems were better live than on record, which would beunheard of today.As an audience we are able to see \"The Song Remains The Same\" for what itis: a timepiece.Post-1975, Led Zeppelin's work became gradually lower inquality and as Punk revolutionised the music scene, they became dinosaurs atthe end of the decade.But in this time, their 1971-1975 period, LedZeppelin were the biggest band in the world, and their power is capturedwith brilliant clarity on this film.Whatever happened after this time is amoot point; this is how Led Zeppelin should and will be remembered.A mustfor any serious music fan.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Song Remains the Same (1976)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserFave Zep Song!!!!!

I love Winnie the Pooh and I love watching most of his filmsbut I can safely say that this one is unbearable! Rabbit hates Easterand becomes emotionally saddened about it for a very pointless reason -because he felt left out when everyone else was having fun! Thenarrator is more of one of the supporting characters and just likeeveryone else, he acts like a total idiot. Also, I can't believe peoplemake far too big a deal of \"Rabbit's Rubbish Reason\" as I call it. Whycan't they just say \"oh, Rabbit, surely you're not getting into a stateover just that! Snap out of it, pal!\" instead of \"oh, dear, you areunhappy, aren't you? We honestly didn't mean to hurt your feelings,Rabbit. We just wanted Roo to be happy on his first Easter.\" At the endof the film we see Rabbit singing the insufferable song \"Cos what Ilike most about Easter\" and then gives Roo a hug, Tigger criesemotionally at that touching, tearful moment that'll touch the heartsof all that see it - (blowing a raspberry) uh, yeah right!!! Honest toGOD! What's so emotionally moving about having a hug? And, also, what'sso tear-jerking about singing that stupid song? About two years ago mumgot it on video from Safeway and I only saw it once.

One is ascrewball comedy that takes up most of the first half of the movie. Itcovers the romance between Sam, the average Joe sports columnist, and Tess,the sophisticated, globe-trotting political columnist. The scenes where theyboth try and adapt to the others life are hysterical.The second movie covers the relationship as it implausibly deepens intoromance, leading to marriage. The clash of lifestyles and personalitiesdrives the couple further and further apart endangering the marriage.Thismovie is not a comedy.The first half of the movie is mostly comedy, the second mostly drama.Comedy does raise it's head throughout, and this, in my opinion saves themovie from catastrophe. As it is, it's pretty good, but not a classic by anystretch in my opinion.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Woman of the Year (1942)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserThe Couple's BedgjampolBest pairing of Hepburn + Tracy?peartree1402wedding ceremonyhomestead-2classical music in the background?miss_penny_lanemoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:His Girl FridayIntolerable CrueltyI Love TroubleOne Fine DayMuch Ado About NothingIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Part of the success of the movie lies inthe screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era.Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, BernardHermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all theabove mentioned qualities, \"North by Northwest\" was photographed byRobert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men didoutstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspiredAlfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This hasto be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock becauseof the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the reparteebetween her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romancethat aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be reallyhappening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, sowe shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time itturns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others ofthe same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequencesinvolving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve andRoger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his workwith the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grantplayed, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint isperfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture.James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse RoyceLandis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast isexcellent.\"North by Northwest\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted filmsthanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for North by Northwest (1959)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserEmil?ka-armourTheatre Tickets!stomainoA Bad1959 Review of 'North by Northwest'ecarleVan Dam's house in Montana -- was it real?riegelsvillegrrrl'The Midpoint Movie' -- And Almost As Important As PsychoecarleUK trains ad. with NbNW footageswanstepmoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Raiders of the Lost ArkDick Tracy ReturnsxXxMarathon ManLive and Let DieIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

And even if onehas seen the series they still might not get all of this, but that'sthe beauty of Anno's masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End ofEvangelion. This alternate ending to the series was released after fanscomplained about the series original ending. If you've seen theoriginal ending you already know that the actual \"ending\" analyzes thecharacters Shinji, Rei, Asuka, and Misato. While episode 26 of theoriginal series is a complete fixation on Shinji, everything thathappens in that episode still happens to him in the last part of this.Only his decision reverses. This shows a much more dramatic andextended version of Episodes 25 and 26 however, and answers a lot ofthe questions that were left at the end of the series and does a greatjob generating new ones. If you're a fan of the original series thenthis is a must see because it's way better than the original ending.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Shin seiki Evangelion Gekij\u00f4-ban: Air/Magokoro wo, kimi ni (1997)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserShinji is a sick bastard.nutman-2Shinji strangels Auska, is it a dream?krishneelzThe Third Impact - Help!!!Rei_LilithI hope they don't change Shinji.golmichaMost disturbing scene?alfredlimMore detail on how the EVAs were created?darkshadowcobramoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:AkiraKoroshiya 1American BeautyKill Bill: Vol. 1IzoIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Later in the series, the second wave also leaves a rip in theuniverse ('Cosmic Fracture') that the cadets of Stellvia will have tocombat along with some UFOs.The main character, Shima, is a programming genius (and completeklutz). She along with Arisa and her other friends, tough their waythrough the academy and life as they prepare for the missions.This series has a marvelous intro and closing song plus a nice mix ofanimation with CGI that doesn't let the CGI make the series too glossy(like is problematic with series such as IGPX).

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)2 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-pretty good, 7 May 2002Author:Arnoldo_2002 from chicagoThe list of problems I had with this film is long, and I agree withmany of the comments I've read and heard about the film,that it'sunoriginal and a knock-off of Boyz in the Hood, but you know what?Who cares?This film is actually pretty good and has a strongsense of humor to counterbalance it's more serious side. After ahalf an hour of snickering at some awkward scenes, I graduallybegan to get hooked, and by the time thepowerful climax arrived,the director and the actors had won me over. Sure, the film isn'tperfect and some scenes don't work, but rarely do Latinos get 30million dollars to make their personal films, if given the chance tomake films at all. Despite what some people have written aboutthis film, the cinematography is excellent, and so are some of theactors like Jacob Vargas, and the guy who played Gramps isterrifying. The director did a great job with the few resources hehad and his heart and passion are evident in every frame. Onething that bothers me, particularly from fellow Latinos, is thatthey're always ready to knock a film like this by calling it negative,or calling it \"typical\" or saying things like \"not all latinos grew up inthe hood\". Fine. Make your own movie! If you don't like hoodmovies don't watch them, but don't knock a filmmaker for making amovie about something he cares about, just like I wouldn't knockScorcese for making another \"gangster picture\", or the coenBrothers for making another \"film noir\" picture. Film is film, and ifit's well done I'm ready to give it a shot, regardless of the subjectmatter.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Road Dogz (2000)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:My FamilyThe Ice StormWelcome to the DollhouseThe Virgin SuicidesLiberty HeightsIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)2 out of 4 people found the following comment useful:-One of the most believable fantasy movies ever made!, 23 July 2005Author:Efenstor from Krasnoyarsk, RussiaThe visually perfect endless series of paintings: astoundinglybeautiful, surreal and lifeful. One of the most atmospheric movies I'veever seen, fresh and worthy of remembrance. No, it's no action, it'seven somewhat slow. Out of all standards, sometimes it even looks likea sort of a video-clip put to the majestic (not bombastic!) symphonicmusic of Rob Simonsen. Despite of a plenty of dramatic moments the filmstill leaves a good trace. The story looks really like a part of themain character's life, not just a story written by an author:characters appear and disappear playing their roles in the spiritualquest of the hero, the hero moves to his ghost-like aim haunted by thememories of his recently lost love, analyzing his chivalrous past andfinding himself on the rediscovered path of honour. A little-known gem.Hardly believable that someone is still able to make such movies in2003. 10 out of 10.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Westender (2003)Recent Posts (updated daily)User:) . . .i luv it- yea canada. . . :)litesneeze-1The Worst Movie evermarvsan2000QUESTIONyum_a_cookieProduction company Commentsbbrown2676moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:MerlinThe Phantom of the OperaTimelineThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeTristan + IsoldeIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

This film, however, is just ajoke to try and entertain children with a watered-down, lightheartedcomedy movie that fails to be original or entertaining. The animationis crap, the plot line is simple enough to bore you to death, and thevillain is not even a fraction of the greatness Frollo was. All thevillain is after is a stupid bell, how boring is that? The charactersaren't even that likable, even Esmeralda, Phoebus, and Quasi don'tshare the same spark of personality they had in the first film. They'rebasically cardboard cutout characters. The songs are annoying and guesswhat? The may have killed off Frollo, one of the deepest villains inDisney history, but at least they still have the cute gargoylesidekicks! (shoot me now.)

He is a assassin wholives by the code of the Samurai. Apart from him, we also follow the fate ofseveral mafia men(though nowhere near as intimately as we follow Ghost Dog).These two very different groups, Samurai and mafia, are both depictedreasonably well, giving us insight to how the groups work, and, moreimportantly, their code. Both groups live and die by the code, and this isprobably the most important thing in the movie, and it's shown with respectwith both Samurai and mafia; I'm not entirely sure that it's correct all theway through, but that's not what's most important, anyway. The film hasreasonably little action, but it's not supposed to be an action film, by anymeans. It's fairly slow throughout the film, but it never really bores youto the point of not watching any more; I've seen the film at least fivetimes now, so believe me, I know. The film is very stylized and coolthroughout, which definitely has some part in keeping you interested, butthe theme and story/plot plays a bigger part, I think. The plot is prettygood, and though it keeps a fairly slow pace throughout the film, it alsokeeps your interest for the entire duration of the film. The acting is allgood, though not everyone pulls off as excellent a performance as Whitaker.Isaach De Bankol\u00e9 portrays Ghost Dog's best friend, and he does gives agreat performance. So does Camille Winbush, who portrays a girl who GhostDog befriends and discusses books with. The characters are well-writtenand(mostly) credible. I'm not entirely sure that the film does provide atotally correct version of the Code of the Samurai. The soundtrack is great;it's made by the hip-hop artist RZA, but most of it will be enjoyable topeople who aren't into hip-hop. Also, I guess it's more of a score than asoundtrack; there isn't any time where the music feels out of place in ascene. All in all, a great film, but not for all tastes. Don't go inexpecting an action film; don't go in expecting a very deep an entirelyintellectual film; don't go in expecting a regular movie; go in expecting tosee a decent(if not good) representation of both the mafia code and theSamurai code. I've heard some people describe the ending as an anti-climax;I don't know what they were expecting... I won't say that I saw it coming,but I wasn't disappointed when it happened. It had to end it, and I thinkthe director, Jim Jarmusch made a good decision on that. I recommend thisfilm to people with an interest in Samurai, fans of Jarmusch and peoplelooking for a reasonably deep film. I don't recommend this to fans of actionmovies, as there's fairly little action in the film. No matter who you are,if you're going to see this film, make sure you have the patience for it;it's worth sitting through the two reasonably slow hours for.8/10Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserOutstandingNick_Hansonshould a great man lay down his life in the service of a lesser man?jarmytaThe Blackequivalent to 'Grand Theft Auto' fantasies?NeroKalem*beep*corybrackenare you serious??nvp12345Style over substance?

It's a wonderful translation of the story inthe since that all the warmth is there. When fall comes along it FEELSlike fall (same as in the animated version of Ray Bradbury's TheHalloween Tree). Debbie Reynolds' voice is beautiful for Charlotte andfit the animated character's blue/gray smiling face. I'd dare say thestory comes across better than some of Disney's most recent stuff(though I'd still have to bow down to Beauty and The Beast, one of myall-time faves). As far as animation goes, Charlotte's Web proves onceagain that it's all about story; the most beautiful animation in theworld can't save a lousy story...no matter what.

The factthata good portion of events described in the movie aren't historicallyaccurate, doesn't mar the precise and razor sharp script (an Englishtranslation of a German Play). It is hard to distill or summarize thismoviewith any acuity, except to say that the ideas that are described areexactlywhat is required and nothing more.

There's hardly a whiff of aplot, Helen Hayes looks uncomfortable, and Ken Berry is a poor man'sDean Jones. Worse, the special effects are shoddy, the productionvalues cheap, and the slapstick laughs overdrawn by a director whopractically prods you in the ribs. The Disney Company really lost morethan their boss when Walt died; they lost their direction, mostespecially in their live-action entertainment, relying on sequels and(even today) pointless remakes that show a complete misunderstanding ofwhat their founder was trying to do. \"Herbie\" is surely at thatbarrel's bottom.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Herbie Rides Again (1974)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Herbie Goes to Monte CarloHerbie Fully LoadedThe Love BugHerbie Goes BananasToy Story 2IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Not to say that it isn't funny. It'sabsolutely hilarious! But the main thing that appeals to me about Parenthoodis the warm heart that is at the center of it all. These characters havenuanced, complicated, and not overly dramatic problems. Just like REALPEOPLE, and unlike many of the one-faceted characters seen in moviestoday.And what better actor to play Gil than Steve Martin? A comedic genius,Martin is capable of playing anything from slimy to sincere, conformingperfectly to his role, and it helps that he's not a cynic. Also watch forgreat appearances by Tom Hulce, perhaps best known as Amadeus (poor guy,where'd his career go?) and a very young Joaquin Phoenix asGary.All in all, a very funny and very sweet comedy that I will give a9/10!!Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Parenthood (1989)Recent Posts (updated daily)UserNotice link to St. Louis + Missouri?serpno11GarryRowerChickaquestionwhenbersattacklost retainersruddy2002Zachary La Voy ....Justin Buckmanamyk479Picture pick-up goof!ta421sbtrhalfmoreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Mrs. DoubtfireYours, Mine and OursTerms of EndearmentRiding in Cars with BoysLittle Miss SunshineIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Teruo Ishii's direction is alittle flat and uneven and it's quite obvious his passion is femaleflesh, not kinetic action or creating a glorious action/erotic hybrid.Norifumi Suzuki, the director of \"Sex and Fury\", is a more original,energetic director and brought great artistry and aesthetic brillianceto his work. Ishii's accomplishment is a diverting time filler with toomany characters, some intrigue, and mountains of softcore canoodling.The opening fight scene revisits the stylistics of the original film,but quickly dispenses with that style and involves itself inunnecessarily complex plotting. The finale is reasonably bloody, but itnever reaches the towering heights of its predecessor because Ishiidirects it like he's bored.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Yasagure anego den: s\u00f4katsu rinchi (1973)If you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Kuraingu fur\u00eemanFury\u00f4 anego den: Inoshika Och\u00f4Crying Freeman 2: F\u00fbsei kakureiSilver - shirubaaKoroshiya 1IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I guess its a case of - you take your pick - whichever scenarioyou feel like going with.The story concerns Dr. Ty Adams, a handsome young man, who feels mentalpatients can be cured by therapy, that medication is not needed.He comes to Sedah Hospital to prove his theory, and to have it allfilmed by cameras set up throughout the institute as well as a cameracrew being present.The main patients Dr. Adam's deals with are Cheryl a young woman whowas badly abused as a child and who tends to go into defensive ragescombined with depressive withdrawal, and a man who claims he is Satan.Why Satan voluntarily admits himself to the mental hospital is neverexplained. Nothing in this film ever really goes anywhere.

Add the first question.(Comment on this title)7 out of 7 people found the following comment useful:-Very Touching, Involving Story, 24 August 2006Author:ccthemovieman-1 from Lockport, NY, United StatesThis is a wonderful movie. I admit this movie is manipulative, and probably exaggerated forpurposes of drama, but what based-on-a-true story movies aren't? Atleast it goes after the right things: a father having custody of hiskids, rather than them being forced to live in an \"institution.\"The story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which,in the end, the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case.\"Desmond Doyle\" (Pierce Brosnan) is the loving father whose wife runsoff one day with another man, leaving him with three little kids andlittle visible means of support. Since he didn't have enough finances,the government makes the kids wards of the state and places them inCatholic schools-homes (institutions?).On that Catholic, or \"religious,\" angle, you get a lot of positive andnegative scenes here. You have a bad, nasty almost sadistic nun \"SisterBrigid,\" but the others are fine caring ladies, as they should be.Overall, however, you see a lot of faith portrayed in this film andit's mostly good. Of course, that faith was more out in the open in the'50s than today, but it was inspiring to see in many parts.Brosnan is excellent in the lead role, a man everyone can identifywith: a loving but flawed man. He drinks too much, he swears, hedoesn't have a steady job but he has great heart and has greatdetermination to the right thing. One has no trouble rooting for him inthis story. I think it's the best role he has ever played, far betterthan his superficial James Bond or thieves roles he normally plays.Butnobody hits you as emotionally as little Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur), oneof Doyle's three kids and the one that is focused upon here. (The twolittle brothers are not given much screen time, for some reason.)Brosnan's allies in here - the two lawyers (played by Stephen Rea andAiden Quinn) are likable as is Alan Bates who plays a ruggedex-barrister who winds up helping the team. Bates might have had thebest role for the supporting actors.This is such an involving story, one that you really care about thepeople, it can bring a tear or two in the end, but what's wrong withthat? When you are finished watching this film, you feel good.Was the above comment useful to you?moreDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Evelyn (2002)Recent Posts (updated daily)Userirish accentsgreys_obsessyA Evelyn Music Videobut448WORST BOND MOVIE EVER!!bonsai_midgetMy explination on why the movie was more about 'Evelyn' and not the boysDV96Why is this film called Evelyn?Lalena1Very good but...oc7000moreIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:Mommie DearestThe Game of Their LivesCatch Me If You CanSupermanChariots of FireIMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:IMDb User Rating:Add a recommendation |Show more recommendationsYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Where films like Full Meal Jacket and Jarhead present thebehavioural disintegration of their subjects, this film offers a moresubconscious vision of where the personality goes when fragmented bythe rigours of a depersonalising military command. This is not a filmfor viewers after a coherent narrative or a dialogue-driven journey,but for those brave enough to surrender their militant devotion tonarrative film boundaries and spoon-fed cinematic experiences there isplenty here to explore. If films such as Father and Son excited yoururge to introspection, this film will be a worthwhile venture.

High school music teacher Janet Wolff isn't afraid \r\r\nto teach the accordion.\nHer teenage students don't balk at picking up the instrument or performing in \r\r\nan auditorium full of old-timers who take their German traditions seriously.\n\"It's just something different,\" said 17-year-old Kasandra Huber. \"I thought \r\r\nit would be fun. And it is fun.\"\nWishek High School has 110 students. Huber is one of seven who play the \r\r\naccordion, an instrument made famous by Welk, who died in 1992, and the late \r\r\nMyron Floren, who both entertained generations of TV viewers on \"The Lawrence \r\r\nWelk Show.\"\nIn Wishek, a town of about 1,100 people, the accordion players include Jason \r\r\nHochhalter, 18, a muscular high school senior, and Christy Schaffer, 15, a \r\r\npetite, full-blooded German who has been practicing for four years.\n\"When I was younger, I thought it was something different to do,\" Schaffer \r\r\nsaid. \"My grandpa did it. And I thought it would be interesting to play \r\r\nsomething different, that no other kid was playing.\"\nWolff, who grew up in the Minneapolis area, married a German with accordions \r\r\nafter taking the teaching job in Wishek in 1988. She thought the accordion would \r\r\nbe perfect for performances during Sauerkraut Day, an annual sauerkraut and \r\r\nsausage festival held in Wishek for eight decades.\nWolff started teaching the accordion four years ago, using instruments \r\r\nborrowed from people in town. \"It's just another instrument to be exposed to,\" \r\r\nshe said.\n\"I was just going to play it for a day, and then I ended up keeping it,\" said \r\r\nHochhalter, who looks like he would be more at home in a weight-lifting room \r\r\nthan a music room.\nWhen other students chimed in and good-naturedly chided him for \"stealing\" \r\r\nthe accordion from another student, he grinned and added, \"They're just \r\r\njealous.\"\n'Wunnerful, wunnerful'\nThe culture of the farming region also helps, Wolff said. Welk, the \r\r\nbandleader whose \"wunnerful, wunnerful\" show of the 1950s and 1960s can still be \r\r\nseen in public television reruns, grew up in nearby Strasburg. Many older \r\r\nresidents converse in German, and wedding dances still feature polkas and \r\r\nwaltzes, Wolff said.\nLisa Horner, 17, said the student accordion players are following in their \r\r\ngrandparents' footsteps. \"It's kind of cool,\" she said.\nThe students like modern-day music but all know Lawrence Welk. \"My dad \r\r\nwatched all the time,\" Horner said. \"He was like, 'We've got to watch Lawrence \r\r\nWelk.\"'\nHelmi Harrington, who runs music studios in the Minneapolis suburb of \r\r\nBurnsville and in Superior, Wisconsin, is the director of A World of Accordions \r\r\nMuseum in Duluth, Minnesota. She is not surprised to hear that teenagers in \r\r\nNorth Dakota play the accordion.\n\"In the 1990s there was a trend toward nostalgia, toward finding our roots in \r\r\nAmerica,\" she said. \"That always brings people back to ethnic connectors.\"\nHarrington, who has played the accordion for more than half a century, said \r\r\nthe instrument is unique in that it creates melody, harmony and rhythm like a \r\r\npiano or organ, but is more portable.\n\"A single person can shine in a spotlight with marvelous notes,\" she said.\nHowever, with its keyboard, pushbuttons and bellows, \"it is a very difficult \r\r\ninstrument to play well,\" Harrington said.\nWolff said she cannot envision teaching the accordion in a big city like \r\r\nMinneapolis, but has never had a student in Wishek refuse to try it.\n\"It's part of our heritage,\" Huber said.\n\n"}

It is only right \r\r\nthat the rich countries should pay a little more,\" Stern said. \nThe report admitted its forecasts on how climate change would affect the \r\r\nglobal economy rested on sparse data about high temperatures and developing \r\r\ncountries, and put monetary values on human health and the environment, \"which \r\r\nis conceptually, ethically and empirically very difficult.\"\nBut UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said if no action were taken, climate change \r\r\ncould cost the world up to 20 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) \r\r\neach year.\nBlair said: \"This is the most important report on the future published by \r\r\nthis government in its time in office.\" \nThe prospect of global warming is \"frightening,\" but the scientific case that \r\r\nit is taking place is now \"overwhelming,\" the PM added.\n\"This disaster is not set to happen in some science fiction future many years \r\r\nahead, but in our lifetime.\n\"Unless we act now ... these consequences, disastrous as they are, will be \r\r\nirreversible.\" \n'Global solution'\nFinance minister Gordon Brown, who is expected to take over as prime minister \r\r\nnext year, said harnessing markets was the best way to find new methods to cut \r\r\npolluting gases.\nBrown proposed an EU-wide target for emissions reductions of 30 percent by \r\r\n2020 and 60 percent by 2050 and expansion of the carbon trading scheme to cover \r\r\nover half of emissions.\n\"Stern's report sees climate change as a global challenge that demands a \r\r\nglobal solution. The truth is we must tackle climate change internationally or \r\r\nwe will not tackle it at all,\" Brown said.\nAlso Monday, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change said \r\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries were rising and the U.S. \r\r\nremained the biggest polluter. \nThe report puts the UK at odds with its main ally. U.S. President George W. \r\r\nBush withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol -- which urges the 35 richest countries to \r\r\ncut carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels in power plants, factories and \r\r\ncars -- partly because he said it hit jobs.\nBut Stern said the action needed to avert the worst effects of climate change \r\r\nwas \"manageable,\" adding: \"We can grow and be green.\" \nThe Stern review says the costs of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \r\r\nto avoid the worst impacts of climate change can be limited to just 1 percent of \r\r\nglobal GDP each year. \nPeople would pay slightly more for carbon intensive goods, but the world's \r\r\neconomies could continue to grow strongly. \nEnvironmental Economist Professor Stephen Smith, from University College \r\r\nLondon, told CNN the role of Al Gore was important to sell action on climate \r\r\nchange to the rest of the world. \n\"The British government has recognized that it needs to do more than simply \r\r\nspeaking to domestic audience ... it needs to build a new coalition to agree \r\r\ncuts in greenhouse gas emissions on the global stage, and Gore's role is clearly \r\r\nin that.\"\nThe report was welcomed by environmental campaigners and business leaders.\r\r\n\nCharlie Kronick of Greenpeace said it showed the current generation must now \r\r\ndefeat climate change. \n\"We always knew that the scientific and moral case for action was \r\r\noverwhelming, but this report is the final piece in the jigsaw,\" he told the \r\r\nPress Association. \n\"There are no more excuses left, no more smokescreens to hide behind, now \r\r\neverybody has to back action to slash emissions, regardless of party or \r\r\nideology.\" \nRichard Lambert, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, \r\r\nsaid emissions trading between nations was required as a \"nucleus\" for action.\r\r\n\n\"Provided we act with sufficient speed, we will not have to make a choice \r\r\nbetween averting climate change and promoting growth and investment,\" he told \r\r\nPA.\n\n"}
